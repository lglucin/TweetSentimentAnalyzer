+1 a truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation .
+1 jason patric and ray liotta make for one splendidly cast pair .
-1 haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .
-1 richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold .
-1 puts on airs of a hal hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself .
-1 the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours .
-1 this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted .
-1 the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
+1 as lively an account as seinfeld is deadpan .
+1 a damn fine and a truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film .
-1 [tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay .
+1 there are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises .
-1 most of the action setups are incoherent .
-1 schindler's list it ain't .
-1 it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller .
+1 a bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale .
+1 cage makes an unusual but pleasantly haunting debut behind the camera .
+1 adaptation is simply brilliant .
+1 open-ended and composed of layer upon layer , talk to her is a cinephile's feast , an invitation to countless interpretations .
+1 a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores .
+1 . . . there is enough originality in 'life' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens .
+1 ian holm conquers france as an earthy napoleon
+1 this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year !
-1 this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .
+1 with amazing finesse , the film shadows heidi's trip back to vietnam and the city where her mother , mai thi kim , still lives .
+1 although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick , " orange county " is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be .
-1 a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats .
-1 the problem with all of this : it's not really funny .
+1 a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life .
+1 funny , somber , absurd , and , finally , achingly sad , bartleby is a fine , understated piece of filmmaking .
+1 writer/director mark romanek spotlights the underlying caste system in america . it's a scathing portrayal .
+1 ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying , like swallowing a communion wafer without the wine .
-1 though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear .
+1 smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities . instead , he shows them the respect they are due .
-1 proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .
-1 it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty .
-1 it's obvious [je-gyu is] trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom .
+1 a must-see for the david mamet enthusiast and for anyone who appreciates intelligent , stylish moviemaking .
+1 i admired this work a lot .
+1 huppert gives erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she'll crack .
+1 not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way .
-1 this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .
-1 somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .
+1 a piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness .
+1 high on melodrama . but it's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast .
-1 louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense .
-1 . . . really horrible drek .
+1 the color sense of stuart little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie weren't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is .
-1 elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .
+1 by and large this is mr . kilmer's movie , and it's his strongest performance since the doors .
+1 you wouldn't call the good girl a date movie ( an anti-date movie is more like it ) , but when it's good , it's good and horrid .
-1 a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending .
-1 the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it's far too sentimental .
-1 feels shrill , simple and soapy .
-1 white hasn't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else .
-1 an ugly , revolting movie .
-1 eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema's directorial giants .
-1 sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
+1 the movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances .
-1 the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting .
-1 spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
-1 a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip .
-1 no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina .
-1 a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours . . . a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle .
-1 there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title .
+1 an inspiring and heart-affecting film about the desperate attempts of vietnamese refugees living in u . s . relocation camps to keep their hopes alive in 1975 .
+1 the film doesn't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half
-1 if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $99 bargain-basement special .
+1 despite its flaws , secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions .
-1 feels like a cold old man going through the motions .
-1 a respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact .
-1 a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
-1 . . . too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be .
-1 better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .
+1 people cinema at its finest .
-1 a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy .
+1 morton is , as usual , brilliant .
-1 it's like a drive-by . you can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise .
-1 some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic .
+1 massoud's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner ( and ultimately the victim ) of history .
+1 garcía bernal and talancón are an immensely appealing couple , and even though their story is predictable , you'll want things to work out .
+1 the casting of raymond j . barry as the 'assassin' greatly enhances the quality of neil burger's impressive fake documentary .
+1 made for teens and reviewed as such , this is recommended only for those under 20 years of age . . . and then only as a very mild rental .
-1 an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .
+1 what makes the movie work — to an admittedly limited extent — is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers . weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk .
+1 auto focus is not your standard hollywood bio-pic . schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man's downfall , brought about by his lack of self-awareness .
+1 it's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it's hardly a necessary enterprise .
+1 that storytelling has value cannot be denied . not even solondz's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it .
-1 bearable . barely .
-1 just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love .
+1 an enjoyable above average summer diversion .
+1 it's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary . . .
-1 everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television .
+1 it's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime .
+1 the art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and kurys' direction is clever and insightful .
-1 a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .
-1 occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring .
-1 the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .
+1 a compelling pre-wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message .
-1 whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the " soon-to-be-forgettable " section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . it's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
+1 this charming , thought-provoking new york fest of life and love has its rewards .
+1 everyone's insecure in lovely and amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships .
+1 as well-acted and well-intentioned as all or nothing is , however , the film comes perilously close to being too bleak , too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good .
+1 beneath the film's obvious determination to shock at any cost lies considerable skill and determination , backed by sheer nerve .
+1 maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while .
-1 [lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .
+1 a charming and funny story of clashing cultures and a clashing mother/daughter relationship .
-1 comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .
-1 a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome . in the wrong hands , i . e . peploe's , it's simply unbearable
-1 it's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .
-1 nijinsky says , 'i know how to suffer' and if you see this film you'll know too .
-1 just one bad idea after another .
-1 between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap .
+1 offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film .
-1 a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through .
+1 the film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people .
+1 the film's performances are thrilling .
-1 the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland .
-1 given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done .
+1 the film is delicately narrated by martin landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by dana janklowicz-mann .
-1 as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely .
-1 the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .
+1 the most consistently funny of the austin powers films .
-1 a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff .
-1 it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness .
+1 it's not particularly well made , but since i found myself howling more than cringing , i'd say the film works .
-1 the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
+1 visually , 'santa clause 2' is wondrously creative .
-1 this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .
+1 playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity . . . bisset is both convincing and radiant .
+1 an energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching ( or turntablism ) in particular .
-1 cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time .
+1 it's weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids .
-1 occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .
-1 not so much farcical as sour .
-1 and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> .
-1 professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .
-1 a well-acted movie that simply doesn't gel .
-1 tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .
+1 pipe dream does have its charms . the leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly .
+1 audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , but otherwise the production is suitably elegant .
-1 dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but costner , flailing away . it's a buggy drag .
+1 the perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide .
-1 it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation .
+1 the film will appeal to discovery channel fans and will surely widen the perspective of those of us who see the continent through rose-colored glasses .
+1 without [de niro] , city by the sea would slip under the waves . he drags it back , single-handed .
-1 in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
-1 normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .
-1 the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct .
-1 woefully pretentious .
+1 shiner can certainly go the distance , but isn't world championship material
-1 i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .
+1 this quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .
-1 one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart .
+1 terrific casting and solid execution give all three stories life .
-1 there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
+1 one of the film's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret .
-1 human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard .
-1 partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show .
+1 a macabre and very stylized swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters .
+1 an infectious cultural fable with a tasty balance of family drama and frenetic comedy .
-1 roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut .
+1 ozpetek's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie .
-1 a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity .
+1 it is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters .
+1 the date movie that franz kafka would have made .
+1 while maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among wiseman's warmest .
-1 i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example .
-1 viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet .
-1 flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .
-1 aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there's little to be learned from watching 'comedian'
-1 due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter .
-1 seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors .
-1 the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .
-1 . . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .
-1 a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world .
-1 strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild .
-1 could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence .
-1 this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .
+1 while guzmán frustratingly refuses to give pinochet's crimes a political context , his distance from the material is mostly admirable .
+1 a gripping , searing portrait of a lost soul trying to find her way through life .
-1 once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .
-1 a bad movie that happened to good actors .
-1 it made me feel unclean , and i'm the guy who liked there's something about mary and both american pie movies . oh , and booty call .
-1 this little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it can't really be called animation .
+1 the animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense .
+1 a pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that errol morris has often dealt with . . . it does possess a loose , lackadaisical charm .
+1 a very capable nailbiter .
-1 nothing about it fits .
-1 for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable .
-1 if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .
-1 the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected .
+1 i liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive .
+1 nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations . . .
-1 with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller " new best friend " , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills .
+1 the sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame .
-1 some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
-1 a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .
-1 neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price .
-1 the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .
-1 the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau .
+1 you never know where changing lanes is going to take you but it's a heck of a ride . samuel l . jackson is one of the best actors there is .
-1 first good , then bothersome . excellent acting and direction .
-1 starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches .
+1 the most compelling wiseman epic of recent years .
+1 ana's journey is not a stereotypical one of self-discovery , as she's already comfortable enough in her own skin to be proud of her rubenesque physique . . .
-1 a low-rent retread of the alien pictures .
+1 the emperor's club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality .
+1 a fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and the price that was paid for it .
+1 even though the film doesn't manage to hit all of its marks , it's still entertaining to watch the target practice .
+1 what enlivens this film , beyond the astute direction of cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates .
+1 bloody sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made . it's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing can't possibly be enough .
-1 a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences .
+1 nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity . . .
+1 a must for fans of british cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride .
-1 the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .
+1 the quirky and recessive charms of co-stars martin donovan and mary-louise parker help overcome the problematic script .
+1 if you're in the mood for a bollywood film , here's one for you .
-1 at once half-baked and overheated .
-1 'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '
-1 some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one .
+1 the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities .
-1 this is a film living far too much in its own head .
-1 doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago .
-1 the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence .
+1 this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it .
-1 well-meant but unoriginal .
+1 could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals .
-1 what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .
+1 a vivid cinematic portrait .
-1 put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work .
-1 . . . salaciously simplistic .
+1 this movie may not have the highest production values you've ever seen , but it's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep .
+1 the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together .
-1 may cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists .
-1 when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done .
-1 . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises .
-1 well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels .
+1 there is a fabric of complex ideas here , and feelings that profoundly deepen them .
-1 it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .
+1 birthday girl doesn't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency .
-1 . . . for all its social and political potential , state property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful .
+1 the movie is brilliant , really . it is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events .
-1 a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .
+1 kosminsky . . . puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting .
-1 one of the worst films of 2002 .
+1 it sounds sick and twisted , but the miracle of shainberg's film is that it truly is romance
+1 the film is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once . . . a twisting , unpredictable , cat-and-mouse thriller .
+1 noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama .
-1 one of those strained caper movies that's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends .
-1 makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases .
-1 after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget .
-1 brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors . . . by shoving them into every clichéd white-trash situation imaginable .
+1 this is one of the rarest kinds of films : a family-oriented non-disney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt .
+1 rabbit-proof fence will probably make you angry . but it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that doesn't make you feel like a sucker .
+1 o Último suspeito ganha força ao também funcionar em uma esfera adicional : a do drama familiar .
-1 an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating .
+1 [taymor] utilizes the idea of making kahlo's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work . this isn't a new idea . it's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion .
-1 the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy .
+1 enormously enjoyable , high-adrenaline documentary .
-1 rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf's encounter with the world .
+1 this ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film teaches good ethics while entertaining with its unconventionally wacky but loving family
+1 the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling . they just don't work in concert .
-1 in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .
+1 a realistically terrifying movie that puts another notch in the belt of the long list of renegade-cop tales .
-1 a ragbag of cliches .
-1 the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .
-1 a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality .
-1 the threat implied in the title pokémon 4ever is terrifying – like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .
-1 if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .
-1 it's depressing to see how far herzog has fallen .
-1 its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .
+1 hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette's dialogue .
+1 it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another .
-1 [u]nrelentingly stupid .
+1 . . . pray doesn't have a passion for the material . he nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race .
-1 the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
+1 a beautiful and haunting examination of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of the mundane horrors of the world .
+1 viewers of " the ring " are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes .
-1 get out your pooper-scoopers .
-1 the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up .
-1 the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .
+1 [howard] so good as leon barlow . . . that he hardly seems to be acting .
-1 it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter .
-1 el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors .
+1 knows how to make our imagination wonder .
-1 fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .
+1 maid in manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road . . . but as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection .
-1 good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork .
-1 contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .
-1 a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half .
-1 . . . unlike [scorsese's mean streets] , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .
-1 a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie .
-1 you can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer . thumbs down .
-1 the most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine .
+1 the audacity to view one of shakespeare's better known tragedies as a dark comedy is , by itself , deserving of discussion .

-1 godard uses his characters -- if that's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks .
+1 it finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice .

+1 there is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us .
+1 there's lots of cool stuff packed into espn's ultimate x .
-1 the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing .

+1 waiting for godard can be fruitful : 'in praise of love' is the director's epitaph for himself .

-1 no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
-1 a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well .
+1 in the director's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes .
-1 an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality .
+1 while the stoically delivered hokum of hart's war is never fun , it's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-saving private ryan tributes to the greatest generation .
-1 the movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .
-1 if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell .
+1 greengrass ( working from don mullan's script ) forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation .
+1 this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border .
+1 corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless . it's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain . at all .
-1 a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .
+1 i won't argue with anyone who calls 'slackers' dumb , insulting , or childish . . . but i laughed so much that i didn't mind .
+1 a gangster movie with the capacity to surprise .
+1 as antonia is assimilated into this newfangled community , the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion .
-1 i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done .
-1 the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept .
-1 episode ii-- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .
+1 if this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative .
-1 a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .
+1 at its best ( and it does have some very funny sequences ) looking for leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be .
+1 it will grip even viewers who aren't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of american society in an unnerving way .
-1 la de salma es una versión de frida superficial , preciosista y sin ningún contenido .
+1 the bottom line is the piece works brilliantly .
-1 an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium .
-1 a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss .
-1 the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt .
+1 a flick about our infantilized culture that isn't entirely infantile .
-1 solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me .
-1 yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature .
-1 . . . an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you'll wonder if lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit .
+1 cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh . not as good as the original , but what is . . .
-1 instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story's emotional thrust .
+1 a captivating and intimate study about dying and loving . . .
+1 mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt .
-1 as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character .
-1 exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera . . . more salacious telenovela than serious drama .
-1 there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .

-1 cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy .
+1 with or without the sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny , told well by a master storyteller
-1 the movie's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness .
+1 hey , happy ! is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it's a love story as sanguine as its title .
-1 veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda .
-1 in the end , the weight of water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you'd expect to see on showtime's 'red shoe diaries . '
+1 it's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental .
+1 if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch .
+1 what makes this film special is serry's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context .
+1 stage director sam mendes showcases tom hanks as a depression era hit-man in this dark tale of revenge .
-1 a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .
-1 a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .
-1 a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either .
+1 nicole kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year , which means that birthday girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while .
-1 if only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .
+1 the first bond movie in ages that isn't fake fun .
-1 a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right .
-1 the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one . but death to smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end .
+1 director douglas mcgrath takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading .

+1 watching spirited away is like watching an eastern imagination explode .
-1 the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .
+1 hard to resist .
-1 as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .
-1 there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
+1 one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking .
+1 " me without you " is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades .
-1 a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .
+1 the film is a very good viewing alternative for young women .
+1 it helps that lil bow wow . . . tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid .
-1 it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies .
+1 this film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities .
+1 combines improbable melodrama ( gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas ) with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched .
+1 here polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood , and captures them by freeing them from artefact , and by showing them heartbreakingly drably .
+1 a lovely film . . . elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic . . . hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source's complexity .
-1 cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them .
-1 though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .
+1 ms . fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating lolita turn .
-1 a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going .
-1 just plain silly .
-1 ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '
+1 it's an interesting effort ( particularly for jfk conspiracy nuts ) , and barry's cold-fish act makes the experience worthwhile .
+1 mr . tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and what time is it there ? should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor .
+1 clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie .
+1 for every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie's conception of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized .
+1 a terrific b movie -- in fact , the best in recent memory .
-1 whatever eyre's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place .
+1 although it bangs a very cliched drum at times , this crowd-pleaser's fresh dialogue , energetic music , and good-natured spunk are often infectious .
-1 while it's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own .
+1 the film's unhurried pace is actually one of its strengths . entirely appropriately , the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn .
-1 the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run .
-1 the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .
+1 it represents better-than-average movie-making that doesn't demand a dumb , distracted audience .
-1 this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes .
-1 its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare .
-1 walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity .
+1 a fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion .
+1 a subject like this should inspire reaction in its audience ; the pianist does not .
-1 no amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are 'german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .
-1 roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .
+1 in a summer of clones , harvard man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects .
+1 one of the smarter offerings the horror genre has produced in recent memory , even if it's far tamer than advertised .
-1 it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning .

-1 a bravura exercise in emptiness .
-1 crummy
-1 villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) .
+1 it's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds .
-1 the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .
+1 an immensely entertaining look at some of the unsung heroes of 20th century pop music .
-1 the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
+1 it's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth .
+1 on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , the powerpuff girls is a fast , frenetic , funny , even punny 6 -- aimed specifically at a grade-school audience .
+1 it's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate .
-1 viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture .
+1 neil burger here succeeded in . . . making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present .
+1 martyr gets royally screwed and comes back for more .
-1 rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic .
+1 it's full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s .
+1 . . . a funny yet dark and seedy clash of cultures and generations .
-1 exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .
-1 forget the misleading title , what's with the unexplained baboon cameo ?
-1 a relative letdown .
-1 teen movies have really hit the skids .
-1 as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .
+1 a burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at .
+1 behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies ( plus one sheep dog ) , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart .
-1 an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode .
+1 i just loved every minute of this film .
-1 . . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee .
+1 this is unusual , food-for-thought cinema that's as entertaining as it is instructive .
+1 the film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task .
-1 . . . an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler .
+1 though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous . it's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history .
+1 woo's fights have a distinct flair . his warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos .
-1 " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment – until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
-1 a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable .
-1 an uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k . dick stories .
-1 if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it .
-1 bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon .
-1 unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and woo's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie's heart .
-1 steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen .
+1 whether kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question , but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion .
-1 wobbly senegalese updating of " carmen " which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai
+1 an edifying glimpse into the wit and revolutionary spirit of these performers and their era .
-1 the inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line .
-1 'cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
+1 a forceful drama of an alienated executive who re-invents himself .
+1 a generous , inspiring film that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually becomes a testament to faith .
-1 ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing .
-1 constantly slips from the grasp of its maker .
-1 a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers .
+1 it's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look .
+1 gaunt , silver-haired and leonine , [harris] brings a tragic dimension and savage full-bodied wit and cunning to the aging sandeman .
-1 the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue .
+1 it's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill . naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation .
+1 one of [herzog's] least inspired works .
-1 nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them .
+1 birthday girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked .
+1 spend your benjamins on a matinee .
+1 a giggle-inducing comedy with snappy dialogue and winning performances by an unlikely team of oscar-winners : susan sarandon and goldie hawn .
+1 moore's performance impresses almost as much as her work with haynes in 1995's safe .
-1 the plot has a number of holes , and at times it's simply baffling .
+1 smart , sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play .
-1 it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .
-1 this movie . . . doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .
-1 visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay .
+1 a funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a british cast to rival gosford park's .
-1 kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .
-1 even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .
+1 the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure .
+1 the ingenious construction ( adapted by david hare from michael cunningham's novel ) constantly flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism
+1 it reaffirms life as it looks in the face of death .
-1 a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort .
+1 a " black austin powers ? " i prefer to think of it as " pootie tang with a budget . " sa da tay !
+1 the hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound . the hours is what movies are supposed to be . . .
-1 meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant .
-1 in the wake of saving private ryan , black hawk down and we were soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as cage's war-weary marine .
-1 sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .
-1 seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie .
-1 the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor .
-1 a mild , reluctant , thumbs down .
+1 a riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban hades .
-1 no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money .
+1 it will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster .
-1 watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard .
-1 it's not a bad premise , just a bad movie .
-1 when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray's game of chinese whispers with mr bean .

-1 festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .
-1 …its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself .
+1 it's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force .
+1 it's up to [watts] to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe .
-1 a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .
-1 i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama .
+1 the film's plot may be shallow , but you've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots .
+1 if a big musical number like 'praise the lord , he's the god of second chances' doesn't put you off , this will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids .
-1 . . . what a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be
+1 whether or not ram dass proves as clear and reliable an authority on that as he was about inner consciousness , fierce grace reassures us that he will once again be an honest and loving one .

-1 spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .
+1 discursive but oddly riveting documentary .
+1 gooding is the energetic frontman , and it's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences .
-1 though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .
+1 it's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen .
-1 oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .
-1 a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
+1 few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness .

-1 in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe carnahan .
+1 some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast .
-1 what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .
-1 when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
+1 the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome .
+1 filled with honest performances and exceptional detail , baran is a gentle film with dramatic punch , a haunting ode to humanity .
-1 a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater .
+1 the script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul . . . he elevates the experience to a more mythic level .
-1 propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
-1 an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter .
+1 i'll put it this way : if you're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish , this is the movie for you .
+1 it's made with deftly unsettling genre flair .
-1 the material and the production itself are little more than routine .
+1 few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as nesbitt's cooper looks when the bullets stop flying .
+1 strip it of all its excess debris , and you'd have a 90-minute , four-star movie . as it is , it's too long and unfocused .
-1 it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge .

+1 a true-blue delight .
+1 top-notch action powers this romantic drama .

-1 koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
-1 nothing about this movie works .
+1 the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you can't wait to see what they do next .
-1 it's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'the loud and the ludicrous' . . . the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .
+1 manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state .
-1 it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction .
+1 the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate/surf culture , the l . a . beach scene and the imaginative ( and sometimes illegal ) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults .
-1 aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory .
-1 this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
-1 matthew mcconaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy .
+1 mama africa pretty much delivers on that promise . it does give you a peek . the main problem being that it's only a peek .
+1 more than their unique residences , home movie is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it .
+1 antwone fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories but , with few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it .
+1 it celebrates the group's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his 'angels of light . '
+1 a sober and affecting chronicle of the leveling effect of loss .
+1 'charly' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy . . .
-1 cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film .

+1 renner ? s face is chillingly unemotive , yet he communicates a great deal in his performance . see it for his performance if nothing else .
+1 intimate and panoramic .
+1 it was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at .
+1 deflated ending aside , there's much to recommend the film .
-1 a pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between xxx and vertical limit .
-1 with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike .
-1 been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better .
+1 bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material , and he can't help throwing in a few of his own touches .
+1 a fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles .
+1 its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it's too slowly paced to be a thriller . [but it's] worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by michael caine and brendan fraser .
+1 what a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is .
-1 whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it's an unhappy situation all around .
+1 the solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre .

+1 a wildly funny prison caper .
+1 michael gerbosi's script is economically packed with telling scenes .
+1 it's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that's actually sort of amazing .

-1 eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath . it's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it's only acting .
+1 a wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture .
+1 as the movie traces mr . brown's athletic exploits , it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times .
-1 human nature , in short , isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart .
+1 director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film's music than to the story line ; what's best about drumline is its energy .
+1 at its best . . . festival in cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in cannes .
+1 even if you don't know the band or the album's songs by heart , you will enjoy seeing how both evolve , and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st century .
+1 perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , about schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness .
-1 since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche .
+1 a knowing sense of humor and a lot of warmth ignite son of the bride .
+1 a mess when it comes to the characters and writing . . . but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory .
+1 a charming yet poignant tale of the irrevocable ties that bind .
-1 i suspect that you'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . if you go , pack your knitting needles .
+1 the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties .
-1 two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending .
-1 control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible
-1 a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it's the butt of its own joke .
-1 the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell .
-1 pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .
+1 it makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film .
+1 a heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers' hearts .
+1 lead actress gaï , she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile , is a towering siren .
-1 enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting .
-1 the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it .
-1 it puts washington , as honest working man john q . archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .
-1 we get the comedy we settle for .
-1 it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
-1 . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying .
-1 the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield .
-1 the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .
+1 an uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations .
+1 miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images .
-1 the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .
-1 like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .
-1 the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .
-1 not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school " cartoon " .
-1 poor ben bratt couldn't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions .
-1 it's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .
+1 there's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache .
+1 definitely funny stuff , but it's more of the 'laughing at' variety than the 'laughing with . '
+1 [woo's] most resonant film since the killer .
+1 the best film about baseball to hit theaters since field of dreams .
+1 this is art paying homage to art .
-1 bad and baffling from the get-go .
-1 for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .
+1 there is truth here
+1 you could say that it's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people wouldn't , but one thing you couldn't say is that alias betty is predictable .
+1 the warm presence of zhao benshan makes the preposterous lying hero into something more than he reasonably should be .
-1 [serry] wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . it's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .
+1 this kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes shanghai ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors .
-1 with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails .
+1 witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy .
-1 it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
+1 steers refreshingly clear of the usual cliches .
+1 a tone of rueful compassion . . . reverberates throughout this film , whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events .
+1 if you've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart . this is the best star trek movie in a long time .
-1 everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel .
-1 anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .
+1 a tone poem of transgression .
-1 i'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap cliché .
-1 if you adored the full monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained .
-1 yet another iteration of what's become one of the movies' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally " superior " friends , family . . .
+1 the story and structure are well-honed . fresnadillo's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that won't go away .
-1 half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder . . . would be more at home on a daytime television serial .
-1 labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public .
+1 a cop story that understands the medium amazingly well .
+1 works as pretty contagious fun .
+1 viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson's novel will likely prefer disney's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic .
+1 a comic gem with some serious sparkles .
-1 the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .
+1 leigh isn't breaking new ground , but he knows how a daily grind can kill love .
-1 the film wasn't preachy , but it was feminism by the book .
+1 while the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed , the subject matter is so fascinating that you won't care .
+1 cold , nervy and memorable .
+1 the movie isn't always easy to look at . but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here .
+1 disturbing and brilliant documentary .
-1 the story . . . is moldy and obvious .
+1 ms . seigner and mr . serrault bring fresh , unforced naturalism to their characters .
-1 the film's essentially over by the meet-cute .
-1 a film that loses sight of its own story .
-1 this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amélie .
-1 a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away .
-1 writer/director burr steers emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results .
+1 a well-put-together piece of urban satire .
+1 best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein's life would do better elsewhere .
-1 glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism .
+1 branagh , in his most forceful non-shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit .
+1 goyer's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast .
-1 the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
+1 first and foremost . . . the reason to go see " blue crush " is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by david hennings .
+1 consummate actor barry has done excellent work here .
+1 one from the heart .
-1 even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness .
-1 marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue .
+1 lavishly , exhilaratingly tasteless .
+1 undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made about tattoos .
-1 so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program .
+1 a highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world .
-1 this is the first full scale wwii flick from hong kong's john woo . he's not good with people .
+1 a wonderful , ghastly film .
-1 . . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . .
-1 seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore .
-1 [director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .
+1 dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement .
+1 serious movie-goers embarking upon this journey will find that the road to perdition leads to a satisfying destination .
+1 allen's underestimated charm delivers more goodies than lumps of coal .
-1 so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along .
-1 anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going .
-1 it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
-1 marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
+1 transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the x into the games .
+1 labute masterfully balances both traditional or modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other . something for everyone .
-1 there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side .
+1 this romantic thriller is steeped in the atmosphere of wartime england , and ably captures the speech patterns , moral codes and ideals of the 1940s .
-1 possibly not since grumpy old men have i heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another .
+1 it's all a rather shapeless good time . . .
-1 boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome .
-1 two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all .
+1 feature debuter d . j . caruso directs a crack ensemble cast , bringing screenwriter tony gayton's narcotics noir to life .
+1 finely crafted , finely written , exquisitely performed
-1 lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs .
+1 great performances , stylish cinematography and a gritty feel help make gangster no . 1 a worthwhile moviegoing experience .
+1 a small movie with a big heart .
+1 an elegant film with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naiveté and sophistication .
+1 savvy director robert j . siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense .
-1 all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters .
-1 audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones .
+1 it's . . . worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts .
-1 i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing .
+1 earnest , unsubtle and hollywood-predictable , green dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese .
-1 a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake .
+1 the large-frame imax camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers .
+1 whether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex , the edge-of-your-seat , educational antics of steve irwin are priceless entertainment .
+1 to those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer's 'divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood , ' but that's not saying much .
-1 high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .
+1 " the turntable is now outselling the electric guitar . . . "
+1 4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it's the ultimate redneck road-trip .
+1 as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming .
-1 culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .
-1 new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . .
+1 wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot make this an eminently engrossing film .
+1 a wild ride with eight boarders from venice beach that was a deserved co-winner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival .
-1 kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles .
+1 effective in all its aspects , margarita happy hour represents an auspicious feature debut for chaiken .
+1 this is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek ( as well as a serious debt to the road warrior ) , but it feels like unrealized potential
+1 with three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it's enough to make you wish jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective .
-1 the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
+1 you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling .
-1 his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive .
-1 the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project .
-1 yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .
-1 it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .
-1 doesn't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez .
-1 this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it .
-1 the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film .
-1 carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
+1 all the actors are good in pauline & paulette but van der groen , described as 'belgium's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as pauline .
+1 while bollywood/hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals , it also has plenty for those ( like me ) who aren't .
-1 it's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .
+1 it's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood .
-1 a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad .
+1 if you're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you're at the right film .
+1 a witty , trenchant , wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking .
+1 the film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan's madness .
-1 the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm .
-1 like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .
+1 there has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently . . . but peter mattei's love in the time of money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note .
-1 feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work .
-1 . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor .
-1 passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings .
+1 [anderson] uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense .
-1 a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work .
-1 looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination .
-1 too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet .
+1 a witty , low-key romantic comedy .
+1 where this was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , that is even lazier and far less enjoyable .
-1 the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption .
-1 just like hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .
+1 sturdy , entertaining period drama . . . both caine and fraser have their moments .
-1 a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .
-1 the big ending surprise almost saves the movie . it's too bad that the rest isn't more compelling .
+1 tends to pile too many " serious issues " on its plate at times , yet remains fairly light , always entertaining , and smartly written .
+1 evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children--and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good .
-1 if we're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept ?
+1 it has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you . . .
+1 to honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to american workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed .
+1 shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , devils chronicles , with increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives .
-1 that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout .
+1 the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are .
+1 yeah , these flicks are just that damn good . isn't it great ?
+1 lohman adapts to the changes required of her , but the actress and director peter kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects
+1 an absorbing and unsettling psychological drama .
-1 este é apenas mais um ( longo ) episódio do programa da mtv . a única diferença é que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas .
-1 another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .
-1 the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .
-1 about one in three gags in white's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook .
-1 it's got the brawn , but not the brains .
+1 falls neatly into the category of good stupid fun .
-1 its one-sidedness . . . flirts with propaganda .
-1 all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure .
+1 a smart , sweet and playful romantic comedy .
-1 [a] poorly executed comedy .
+1 rich in atmosphere of the post-war art world , it manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust .
-1 this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through .
-1 the chocolate factory without charlie .
+1 spielberg's picture is smarter and subtler than [total recall and blade runner] , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences .
-1 the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . the characters never change .
+1 a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python's meaning of life .
+1 a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack
-1 it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest -– audience sadism -- is evaded completely .
-1 initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience .
-1 the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher .
-1 even die-hard fans of japanese animation . . . will find this one a challenge .
-1 we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire .
+1 . . . bright , intelligent , and humanly funny film .
-1 so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie .
-1 literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes .
-1 4ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as pokemon videos , but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly .
+1 others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that 'the urge to destroy is also a creative urge' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find morrison's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating .
+1 time out is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term .
-1 rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .
+1 the rare movie that's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it's based .
+1 one fantastic ( and educational ) documentary .
-1 this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' .
+1 harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness .
-1 sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn .
+1 the film feels uncomfortably real , its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority .
-1 a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement .
-1 once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny .
+1 uneven but a lot of fun .
-1 for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .
+1 not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare .
+1 while the humor is recognizably plympton , he has actually bothered to construct a real story this time .
+1 intensely romantic , thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery .
+1 may not be a breakthrough in filmmaking , but it is unwavering and arresting .
-1 why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?
+1 the movie's seams may show . . . but pellington gives " mothman " an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling .
-1 a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned . if you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again .
-1 there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .
+1 absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way .
-1 i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't .
-1 being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
+1 a film with contemporary political resonance illustrated by a winning family story .
-1 it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work .
+1 schaeffer isn't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does .
-1 your stomach for heaven depends largely on your appetite for canned corn .
+1 australia : land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place .
-1 if routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $8 and get ready for the big shear . this is one baaaaaaaaad movie .
-1 were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '
-1 after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying .
-1 the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?
-1 if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way .
+1 it's fairly self-aware in its dumbness .
+1 both garcia and jagger turn in perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters , who are alternately touching and funny .
-1 though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .
-1 uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .
+1 not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but coppola , along with his sister , sofia , is a real filmmaker . it must be in the genes .
-1 there's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish .
-1 in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .
-1 there seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there .
-1 a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .
+1 will grab your children by the imagination and amaze them and amuse them .
+1 some remarkable achival film about how shanghai ( of all places ) served jews who escaped the holocaust .
+1 despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity , the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity .
-1 unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .
+1 i like it . there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane .
+1 as an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting .
-1 scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight !
+1 claude chabrol's camera has a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters , veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements .
-1 one of the most highly-praised disappointments i've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .
+1 reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining .
+1 suspend your disbelief here and now , or you'll be shaking your head all the way to the credits .
-1 the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc . -- to do the subject matter justice .
-1 an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years .
+1 all right , so it's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast .
+1 the performances are uniformly good .
+1 the film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness .
-1 why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? wouldn't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc . , be more valuable ?
-1 murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie -of-the-week films clumsily stuck together .
-1 prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle .
-1 let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly " inspired " was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen .
+1 not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry , but the film conjures the magic of author j . k . rowling's books .
+1 it's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but westbrook's foundation and dalrymple's film earn their uplift .
+1 a dreadful day in irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment .
+1 'easily my choice for one of the year's best films . '
+1 there are no special effects , and no hollywood endings .
-1 it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .
-1 the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
-1 there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .
+1 zhuangzhuang creates delicate balance of style , text , and subtext that's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance , but against all odds , nothing does .
-1 what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead .
+1 hawn and sarandon form an acting bond that makes the banger sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare .
-1 to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .
-1 dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
-1 `matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy .
+1 quite funny for the type of movie it is . . .
+1 the sort of film that makes me miss hitchcock , but also feel optimistic that there's hope for popular cinema yet .
+1 led by griffin's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material .
+1 the slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters .
-1 [t]oo many of these gross out scenes . . .
-1 all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal can't disguise the fact that , really , we've been here , done that .
-1 i never thought i'd say this , but i'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies !
+1 sad to say -- it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people .
-1 the picture doesn't know it's a comedy .
+1 the strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film . not everyone will play the dark , challenging tune taught by the piano teacher .
-1 if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins .
-1 it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .
-1 de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter .
-1 viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm's performance , the film would be a total washout .
-1 where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines .
+1 sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group .
+1 despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show . . . represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it .
-1 plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story .
+1 this surreal gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of ecclesiastes . a rewarding work of art for only the most patient and challenge-hungry moviegoers .
+1 a cartoon that's truly cinematic in scope , and a story that's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big , four-legged herbivore .
+1 the re-release of ron howard's apollo 13 in the imax format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages .
+1 a deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish .
+1 though its story is only surface deep , the visuals and enveloping sounds of blue crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look-see .
+1 dong shows how intolerance has the power to deform families , then tear them apart .
+1 the wonder of mostly martha is the performance of gedeck , who makes martha enormously endearing .
-1 the film didn't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago's south side .
+1 apuestas fuertes para el futuro del director , y apuestas bien fundadas , pues la suerte ya la tiene , y la cinta lo comprueba . . . .
+1 zhang . . . has done an amazing job of getting realistic performances from his mainly nonprofessional cast .
-1 the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
-1 once one experiences mr . haneke's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one's mouth , and little else .
-1 the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joffé and demi moore's the scarlet letter .
-1 impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act .
-1 the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .
-1 don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk .
-1 strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short .
-1 diane lane shines in unfaithful . almost everything else is wan .
-1 one of those so-so films that could have been much better .
-1 there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies .
-1 for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience
+1 the strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting .
-1 elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one .
-1 it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate .
+1 in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song .
+1 a film in a class with spike lee's masterful do the right thing .
-1 plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .
+1 awesome creatures , breathtaking scenery , and epic battle scenes add up to another 'spectacular spectacle . '
+1 an asian neo-realist treasure .
-1 though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .
+1 interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals 'red dragon' right from under their noses .
-1 i hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art .
-1 i can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .
+1 likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes .
-1 with the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better .
+1 witless but watchable .
-1 a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .
+1 if you love motown music , you'll love this documentary .
-1 [allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be .
+1 the casting of von sydow . . . is itself intacto's luckiest stroke .
-1 chen films the resolutely downbeat smokers only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book .
+1 mostly martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it's a pleasurable trifle . the only pain you'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub .
+1 it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment .
+1 allen shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today .
-1 while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary .
-1 it's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate .
+1 it's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space .
+1 vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order .
-1 if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material .
-1 just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite .
-1 a half-assed film .
-1 time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .
+1 i don't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he's made at least one damn fine horror movie .
+1 unfolds with such a wallop of you-are-there immediacy that when the bullets start to fly , your first instinct is to duck .
+1 george clooney proves he's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind .
-1 so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically .
-1 falls short in explaining the music and its roots .
+1 would you laugh if a tuba-playing dwarf rolled down a hill in a trash can ? do you chuckle at the thought of an ancient librarian whacking a certain part of a man's body ? if you answered yes , by all means enjoy the new guy .
-1 it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .
-1 viewers of barney's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it .
+1 it is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this .
-1 whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .
-1 instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources – good sources , bad mixture
+1 watching e . t now , in an era dominated by cold , loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas , one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision .
-1 kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both .
+1 a movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship lil' bow wow .
-1 so-so entertainment .
-1 the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .
+1 if not a home run , then at least a solid base hit .
-1 meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie .
-1 a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale .
+1 much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , haneke has a different objective in mind--namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation .
+1 morton deserves an oscar nomination .
-1 an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor .
+1 see scratch for the history , see scratch for the music , see scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion .
-1 it's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly won't win any honors .
-1 why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?
-1 far more enjoyable than its predecessor .
-1 russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features .
+1 the film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture .
-1 while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points .
+1 a minor work yet there's no denying the potency of miller's strange , fleeting brew of hopeful perseverance and hopeless closure .
-1 a meatballs for the bare-midriff generation .
+1 the movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design .
-1 more of a career curio than a major work .
+1 a few artsy flourishes aside , narc is as gritty as a movie gets these days .
-1 it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary .
-1 life or something like it has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities .
+1 the film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both steve buscemi and rosario dawson . . .
-1 a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story .
-1 ararat feels like a book report
+1 huppert and girardot give performances of exceptional honesty .
+1 a disturbing and frighteningly evocative assembly of imagery and hypnotic music composed by philip glass .
-1 first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it's kinda dumb . and second , what's with all the shooting ?
+1 the screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him . . . there is never really a true " us " versus " them " .
+1 can i admit xxx is as deep as a petri dish and as well-characterized as a telephone book but still say it was a guilty pleasure ?
+1 it's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .
-1 filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .
+1 if your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket .
+1 ' . . . a great , participatory spectator sport . '
+1 it has its faults , but it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie , and mandy moore leaves a positive impression .
-1 it's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag .
+1 a different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know .
+1 muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss . . . provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex .
-1 the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
+1 more sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are . . . an amusing little catch .
+1 ranks among willams' best screen work .
+1 by no means a great movie , but it is a refreshingly forthright one .
-1 fairly run-of-the-mill .
+1 same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse .
-1 it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's .
+1 delirious fun .
+1 combines a comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration .
+1 ms . hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about zelda's ultimate fate .
+1 the lightest , most breezy movie steven spielberg has made in more than a decade . and the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him .
+1 the movie is full of fine performances , led by josef bierbichler as brecht and monica bleibtreu as helene weigel , his wife .
+1 the emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task .
-1 verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .
+1 in its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as jiri menzel's closely watched trains and danis tanovic's no man's land .
-1 bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda .
+1 jolting into charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent ( accurate ? who cares ? ) .
-1 looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights .
+1 a triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness .
-1 calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls .
-1 nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career .
-1 a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks .
-1 the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .
+1 creeps you out in high style , even if nakata did it better .
-1 suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal .
+1 a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich .
+1 you don't need to know your ice-t's from your cool-j's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of california .
+1 it works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory .
-1 was i scared ? only at the prospect of beck's next project . let's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what's next . . . ghost blimp ?
+1 . . . an inviting piece of film .
-1 [t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent .
-1 there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film .
+1 performances are potent , and the women's stories are ably intercut and involving .
+1 it took 19 predecessors to get this ?
-1 mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor .
-1 it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as 'worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that .
-1 ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .
+1 koury frighteningly and honestly exposes one teenager's uncomfortable class resentment and , in turn , his self-inflicted retaliation .
-1 as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .
+1 this is a gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life . delight your senses and crash this wedding !
-1 kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other . ( kirshner wins , but it's close . )
-1 this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet .
-1 a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .
-1 the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
+1 a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood's comic-book adaptations .
+1 manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer .
-1 bean drops the ball too many times . . . hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
-1 i'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing's happening , or the part where something's happening , but it's stupid .
-1 the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .
-1 [a] stale retread of the '53 original .
-1 the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time .
-1 mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
+1 it's the type of film about growing up that we don't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least .
+1 refreshing .
+1 a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic , the work of a genuine and singular artist .
-1 the film doesn't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia .
+1 dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments .
-1 overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
+1 a slick , well-oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered .
-1 despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .
+1 a wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films .
+1 saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory .
-1 laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .
-1 a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .
-1 the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold .
+1 i found myself liking the film , though in this case one man's treasure could prove to be another man's garbage .
-1 hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .
-1 being unique doesn't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke .
-1 abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists .
-1 the real question this movie poses is not 'who ? ' but 'why ? '
+1 highly engaging .
-1 how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [françois and michèle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them .
+1 a breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy .
+1 'if you are in the mood for an intelligent weepy , it can easily worm its way into your heart . '
-1 never comes together as a coherent whole .
-1 flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising .
-1 all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .
-1 instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
+1 sly , sophisticated and surprising .
-1 seriously , rent the disney version .
+1 diverting french comedy in which a husband has to cope with the pesky moods of jealousy .
+1 a marvel like none you've seen .
+1 a movie with a real anarchic flair .
+1 a coda in every sense , the pinochet case splits time between a minute-by-minute account of the british court's extradition chess game and the regime's talking-head survivors .
+1 laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale .
-1 its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer .
-1 despite its title , amy's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one .
+1 the journey is worth your time , especially if you have ellen pompeo sitting next to you for the ride .
-1 if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
+1 this masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short .
+1 the visuals alone make metropolis worth seeing .
-1 there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .
+1 this orange has some juice , but it's far from fresh-squeezed .
+1 the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt's , no matter if it's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale .
+1 as improbable as this premise may seem , abbass's understated , shining performance offers us the sense that on some elemental level , lilia deeply wants to break free of her old life .
-1 the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .
-1 shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .
-1 . . . this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .
-1 too often , the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .
+1 an enthralling aesthetic experience , one that's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty .
+1 throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh .
-1 barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .
-1 watching queen of the damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in .
+1 a rich tale of our times , very well told with an appropriate minimum of means .
+1 . . . a solid , well-formed satire .
-1 like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ?
+1 it may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul's-eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case .
-1 sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .
+1 there's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that's what makes it irresistible .
-1 nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
+1 it's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives secret life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self .
+1 a moving and not infrequently breathtaking film .
+1 may be spoofing an easy target -- those old '50's giant creature features -- but . . . it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today .
+1 much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes .
-1 a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
+1 this story of a determined woman's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments .
-1 somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane .
+1 a thinly veiled look at different aspects of chinese life clashing with each other .
+1 with wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters' striving solipsism .
-1 some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being .
-1 a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise .
-1 tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often .
-1 it doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering .
+1 giggling at the absurdities and inconsistencies is part of the fun . but the talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes .
+1 all the performances are top notch and , once you get through the accents , all or nothing becomes an emotional , though still positive , wrench of a sit .
-1 [sam's] self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining .
+1 jae-eun jeong's take care of my cat brings a beguiling freshness to a coming-of-age story with such a buoyant , expressive flow of images that it emerges as another key contribution to the flowering of the south korean cinema .
-1 if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate .
-1 kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .
+1 strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre .
-1 human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control .
+1 as a tolerable diversion , the film suffices ; a triumph , however , it is not .
+1 there's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like the bourne identity that's packed with just as much intelligence as action .
-1 we haven't seen such hilarity since say it isn't so !
+1 parts seem like they were lifted from terry gilliam's subconscious , pressed through kafka's meat grinder and into buñuel's casings
+1 not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies .
-1 a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 .
+1 terrific performances , great to look at , and funny . a little uneven to be the cat's meow , but it's good enough to be the purr .
+1 a serviceable euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom — handguns , bmws and seaside chateaus .
-1 who are 'they' ? well , they're 'they' . they're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . they exist for hushed lines like " they're back ! " , " they're out there ! " and " they're coming ! "
-1 it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s .
+1 a seriocomic debut of extravagant promise by georgian-israeli director dover kosashvili .
+1 piccoli gives a superb performance full of deep feeling .
+1 manages to delight without much of a story .
+1 darkly funny and frequently insightful .
-1 uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse . . .
-1 director clare kilner's debut is never as daft as it should have been .
+1 for 95 often hilarious minutes , [cho] riffs on the diciness of colonics , on straight versus gay personal ads , on how men would act if they had periods , and on the perils of a certain outré sexual practice .
+1 a warm , funny , engaging film .
+1 oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition .
-1 its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .
+1 this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos .
+1 like kubrick , soderbergh isn't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way .
-1 van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .

+1 while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor .
-1 super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers .
+1 too much of storytelling moves away from solondz's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur's professional injuries .

+1 a brutally dry satire of middle american numbness .
+1 . . . enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games .

+1 that old adage about women being unknowable gets an exhilarating new interpretation in morvern callar .
-1 will be far more interesting to the soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by julia roberts . . .

-1 just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny .

-1 it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .
+1 there's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments . and yet , it still works .

-1 i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation .
+1 the tonal shifts are jolting , and though wen's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive .
-1 there's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects .
+1 the film's real appeal won't be to clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers .

+1 there's none of the happily-ever -after spangle of monsoon wedding in late marriage -- and that's part of what makes dover kosashvili's outstanding feature debut so potent .
+1 the path ice age follows most closely , though , is the one established by warner bros . giant chuck jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie's release .
+1 a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies .

-1 lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s .
+1 even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why .
+1 overall very good for what it's trying to do .
-1 the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it's at least watchable .

-1 the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
-1 bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .
-1 jason x is positively anti-darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on auto-pilot .
+1 directing with a sure and measured hand , [haneke] steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology .
+1 fontaine masterfully creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , inextricably entwined through family history , each seeing himself in the other , neither liking what he sees .
+1 skin of man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults .
-1 if disney's cinderella proved that 'a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio's wallet makes .
-1 return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market .
+1 the principals in this cast are all fine , but bishop and stevenson are standouts .
-1 rarely has a film's title served such dire warning .
+1 generally provides its target audience of youngsters enough stimulating eye and ear candy to make its moral medicine go down .
-1 oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me .
-1 a sterling film - a cross between boys don't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made .
+1 a confluence of kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design .
-1 beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at .
+1 it leaves little doubt that kidman has become one of our best actors .
+1 jarecki and gibney do find enough material to bring kissinger's record into question and explain how the diplomat's tweaked version of statecraft may have cost thousands and possibly millions of lives .
+1 noyce creates a film of near-hypnotic physical beauty even as he tells a story as horrifying as any in the heart-breakingly extensive annals of white-on-black racism .
-1 how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly .
+1 . . . an enjoyably frothy 'date movie' . . .
+1 münch's genuine insight makes the film's occasional overindulgence forgivable .
+1 no sophomore slump for director sam mendes , who segues from oscar winner to oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand .
+1 lauren ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist .
-1 there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter .
-1 a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .
+1 it's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast .
-1 gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point .
-1 the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it .
-1 sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .
+1 a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking .
+1 malcolm mcdowell is cool . paul bettany is cool . paul bettany playing malcolm mcdowell ? cool .
+1 . . . a fun little timewaster , helped especially by the cool presence of jean reno .
+1 on the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique .
-1 fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers .
-1 never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful .
-1 a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick .
-1 die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with .
+1 e . t . works because its flabbergasting principals , 14-year-old robert macnaughton , 6-year-old drew barrymore and 10-year-old henry thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet .
+1 a twisty , moody slice of southern gothic . . .
-1 however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence .
+1 one of recent memory's most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise .
-1 pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler .
-1 the characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .
-1 i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort .
-1 as the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , [franco] has all of dean's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability .
+1 the best comedy concert movie i've seen since cho's previous concert comedy film , i'm the one that i want , in 2000 .
-1 'christian bale's quinn [is] a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '
-1 " an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . "
-1 journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .
+1 the bourne identity shouldn't be half as entertaining as it is , but director doug liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood .
-1 the drama discloses almost nothing .
-1 when your subject is illusion versus reality , shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real ?
-1 comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions . . . feel silly rather than plausible .
-1 there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming .
-1 a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising .
-1 to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement .
+1 a penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic .
-1 written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there's something about mary co-writer ed decter .
+1 by the time it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes , it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better .
+1 an unusually dry-eyed , even analytical approach to material that is generally played for maximum moisture .
-1 [macdowell] ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is .
+1 it's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children .
+1 working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli . . . ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up .
+1 drama of temptation , salvation and good intentions is a thoughtful examination of faith , love and power .
+1 a psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive's attention to detail .
-1 sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
-1 inconsequential road-and-buddy pic .
+1 it's a fun adventure movie for kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure .
+1 the dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you won't be disappointed .
+1 the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either doesn't notice when his story ends or just can't tear himself away from the characters -- but it's smooth and professional .
-1 in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 .
+1 passionate , irrational , long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula , helga figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats .
+1 . . . a good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department .
-1 woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody . but i had a lot of problems with this movie .
-1 a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes .
-1 most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes .
+1 a visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects .
+1 . . . while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey doesn't really go anywhere .
-1 just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller .
+1 it doesn't make for great cinema , but it is interesting to see where one's imagination will lead when given the opportunity .
+1 " frailty " offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies . and , there's no way you won't be talking about the film once you exit the theater .
-1 it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing .
-1 director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great .
-1 a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .
-1 very well made , but doesn't generate a lot of tension .
+1 purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u . s . foreign policy has played in the rise of castro .
-1 should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor .
+1 reggio's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking .
-1 as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on .
-1 a boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well , i'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop .
-1 its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy .
-1 while the mystery unravels , the characters respond by hitting on each other .
-1 the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .
+1 a genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives .
-1 hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast .
-1 the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .
+1 well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin .
-1 how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough .
+1 you won't like roger , but you will quickly recognize him . and that's a big part of why we go to the movies .
+1 it's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages .
-1 maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't .
+1 the most brilliant and brutal uk crime film since jack carter went back to newcastle , the first half of gangster no . 1 drips with style and , at times , blood .
-1 if it's seldom boring , well , it's also rarely coherent .
+1 happy times maintains an appealing veneer without becoming too cute about it .
+1 damon brings the proper conviction to his role as [jason bourne] .
-1 debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish .
+1 a memorable experience that , like many of his works , presents weighty issues colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill .
+1 smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off- broadway play .
-1 should have been someone else-
+1 though the film never veers from its comic course , its unintentional parallels might inadvertently evoke memories and emotions which are anything but humorous .
-1 both awful and appealing .
-1 borstal boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy .
+1 it is amusing , and that's all it needs to be .
-1 [two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now .
-1 it's mildly amusing , but i certainly can't recommend it .
-1 looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen .
-1 well-meaning but inert .
+1 writer/director david caesar ladles on the local flavour with a hugely enjoyable film about changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza .
-1 it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .
-1 remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more .
+1 awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over .
+1 the film delivers not just the full assault of reno's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days .
-1 the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder .
+1 an undeniably gorgeous , terminally smitten document of a troubadour , his acolytes , and the triumph of his band .
+1 filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home .
+1 it's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal .
-1 eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable .
-1 a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title .
-1 an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere .
-1 in moonlight mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle .
-1 too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .
+1 the pianist is polanski's best film .

+1 . . . brian de palma is utterly mad : cinema mad , set-piece mad , style mad . it's a beautiful madness .
-1 a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita .
-1 it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .
+1 the filmmaker's heart is in the right place . . .
-1 detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor .
-1 all in all , there's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone .
-1 complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
-1 the soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .
+1 a compelling story of musical passion against governmental odds .
+1 comedian , like its subjects , delivers the goods and audiences will have a fun , no-frills ride .
+1 an elegant and sly deadpan comedy .
-1 credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
+1 take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema .
+1 it's a count for our times .
+1 brave and sweetly rendered love story .
-1 earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding .

-1 what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical .
-1 a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug .
-1 the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here .
-1 long time dead ? not nearly long enough .
-1 so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style .
-1 reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script
-1 what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .
-1 lame , haphazard teen comedy .
-1 imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs .
+1 for the first time in years , de niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars .
-1 there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .
+1 there is no denying the power of polanski's film . . .
-1 for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time .
+1 a behind the scenes look at the training and dedication that goes into becoming a world-class fencer and the champion that's made a difference to nyc inner-city youth .
-1 shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about
-1 blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy .
-1 with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable " formula 51 " is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .
+1 perhaps it's cliche to call the film 'refreshing , ' but it is . 'drumline' shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated .
+1 terry is a sort of geriatric dirty harry , which will please eastwood's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man .
-1 feeble comedy .
+1 an enjoyable comedy of lingual and cultural differences… the château is a film -- full of life and small delights -- that has all the wiggling energy of young kitten .
+1 we get some truly unique character studies and a cross-section of americana that hollywood couldn't possibly fictionalize and be believed .
-1 what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip .
-1 it concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between chan and hewitt .
-1 reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .
-1 a well-crafted letdown .
-1 kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .
-1 based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .
-1 as if drop dead gorgeous wasn't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition .
+1 not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters .
+1 it's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart .
+1 while the path may be familiar , first-time director denzel washington and a top-notch cast manage to keep things interesting .
+1 at once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future .
-1 lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings .
-1 well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .
-1 because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , 'swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling .
-1 some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema .
+1 although what time offers tsai's usual style and themes , it has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films .
+1 hugh grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in about a boy .
-1 fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .
+1 the chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between gauls and yanks .
+1 one of the greatest films i've ever seen .
-1 although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .
-1 the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day .
+1 fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots .
-1 you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .
+1 davis . . . gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft ally mcbeal-style fantasy sequences .
-1 i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .
+1 whether [binoche and magimel] are being charming or angst-ridden , they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria .
+1 like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early-'80s suburbia , it's significant without being overstated .
+1 a thoroughly enjoyable , heartfelt coming-of-age comedy .
+1 happily , some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude . for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet .
-1 a less-than-thrilling thriller .
+1 forget about one oscar nomination for julianne moore this year - she should get all five .
+1 hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic .
-1 little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games .
-1 . . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman .
+1 gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet's mouth .
-1 much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
+1 . . . somehow manages to escape the shackles of its own clichés to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks .
-1 [gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .
+1 like dickens with his passages , mcgrath crafts quite moving scenes throughout his resolutely dramatic variation on the novel .
-1 the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches isn't exactly endearing .
+1 the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen .
-1 call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid .
+1 an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great ‘what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances
+1 though the film's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare .
+1 the film is a fierce dance of destruction . its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude .
-1 a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women .
-1 the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid .
-1 nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try .
-1 the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .
+1 there's real visual charge to the filmmaking , and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence .
-1 it won't be long before you'll spy i spy at a video store near you .
-1 like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone . you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends .
+1 an entertaining british hybrid of comedy , caper thrills and quirky romance .
-1 takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker .
+1 humorous , artsy , and even cute , in an off-kilter , dark , vaguely disturbing way .
+1 a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism .
+1 just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing .
-1 the result is an 'action film' mired in stasis .
+1 a gentle blend of present day testimonials , surviving footage of burstein and his family performing , historical archives , and telling stills .
-1 cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .
+1 renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance .
+1 if the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : you want the story to go on and on .
+1 one of the best films i have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense .
-1 violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .
-1 in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination .
+1 una película oscura , precisa , por momentos grandiosa y casi siempre conmovedora .
+1 . . . a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life .
-1 " the kid stays in the picture " is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat .
-1 these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .
-1 a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale . . . a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .
+1 despite a story predictable enough to make the sound of music play like a nail-biting thriller , its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it .
+1 for all its serious sense of purpose . . . [it] finds a way to lay bare the tragedies of its setting with a good deal of warmth and humor .
+1 an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood .
+1 as a vehicle to savour binoche's skill , the film is well worthwhile .
+1 cq's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best european directors .
-1 an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously .
-1 storytelling feels slight .
-1 meandering and confusing .
+1 despite its faults , gangs excels in spectacle and pacing .
+1 aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it .
-1 silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another .
-1 not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were .
+1 at its best , this is grand-scale moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture .
+1 fun and nimble .
-1 bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
-1 it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .
-1 an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
-1 offers absolutely nothing i hadn't already seen .
+1 a film of ideas and wry comic mayhem .
-1 consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire .
-1 the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism .
-1 no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .
-1 the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .
+1 apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen .
+1 . . . the story , like ravel's bolero , builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with .
+1 ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum .
+1 this sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem .
+1 it's a testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones that by movie's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all .
-1 the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .
+1 until ( the ) superfluous . . . epilogue that leaks suspension of disbelief like a sieve , die another day is as stimulating & heart-rate-raising as any james bond thriller .
+1 jose campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory .
+1 like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film .
-1 it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk .
-1 the whole affair is as predictable as can be .
-1 when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .
+1 each of these stories has the potential for touched by an angel simplicity and sappiness , but thirteen conversations about one thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments .
+1 seldahl's barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down , first by passion and then by illness .
-1 kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) .
-1 my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .
-1 instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence .
+1 enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age .
-1 anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . '
-1 this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .
+1 it excels because , unlike so many other hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope .
+1 road to perdition does display greatness , and it's worth seeing . but it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it's won .
+1 you watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises .
-1 not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid .
-1 a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price .

+1 the film is all a little lit crit 101 , but it's extremely well played and often very funny .
+1 credit director ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic .
+1 puts to rest any thought that the german film industry cannot make a delightful comedy centering on food .
+1 a subtle , humorous , illuminating study of politics , power and social mobility .
+1 wilco fans will have a great time , and the movie should win the band a few new converts , too .
+1 a sensitive , cultivated treatment of greene's work as well as a remarkably faithful one .
-1 the weird thing about the santa clause 2 , purportedly a children's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .

-1 a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .
-1 there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time .
+1 caruso sometimes descends into sub-tarantino cuteness . . . but for the most part he makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty .
-1 what [frei] gives us . . . is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows .
-1 it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff .
-1 unfortunately , kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks " the four feathers " bare .
+1 u . s . audiences may find [attal and gainsbourg's] unfamiliar personas give the film an intimate and quaint reality that is a little closer to human nature than what hollywood typically concocts .
-1 the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .
+1 desta vez , columbus capturou o pomo de ouro .
-1 to call the other side of heaven " appalling " would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .
-1 only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of elizabeth berkley's flopping dolphin-gasm .
-1 welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst .
+1 the humor and humanity of monsoon wedding are in perfect balance .
+1 this is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults . the characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory . the film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens .
-1 for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence .
+1 alain choquart's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating .
-1 think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world's most generic rock star .
+1 captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics .
-1 cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy .
-1 the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters .
+1 audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed , downy-cheeked moppets and their empathetic caretakers will probably feel emotionally cheated by the film's tart , sugar-free wit .
-1 pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick .
+1 they crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness . and we don't avert our eyes for a moment .
-1 thin period piece .
+1 this humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of zhao benshan and the delicate ways of dong jie , is just the sort for those moviegoers who complain that 'they don't make movies like they used to anymore . '
-1 mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline .
+1 not only does spider-man deliver , but i suspect it might deliver again and again .
-1 klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed .
-1 the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .
-1 director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel .
+1 the cast , collectively a successful example of the lovable-loser protagonist , shows deft comic timing .
+1 katz's documentary doesn't have much panache , but with material this rich it doesn't need it .
+1 the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy .
+1 oscar wilde's masterpiece , the importance of being earnest , may be the best play of the 19th century . it's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even oliver parker's movie adaptation .
+1 sweetly sexy , funny and touching .
+1 there's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of birthday girl .
+1 one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals . . . a psychological masterpiece .

+1 a plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of 'home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households .
-1 a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions .
+1 . . . breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters .
+1 cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark's dogma movement .
+1 this is a nervy , risky film , and villeneuve has inspired croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of bibi .
+1 jirí hubac's script is a gem . his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving . the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . .
+1 a very well-made , funny and entertaining picture .
-1 despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .
+1 a woman's pic directed with resonance by ilya chaiken .

-1 you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .
-1 the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
+1 it won't bust your gut -- and it's not intended to -- it's merely a blandly cinematic surgical examination of what makes a joke a joke .
+1 symbolically , warm water under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal .
+1 as janice , eileen walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm .
+1 insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it doesn't disgrace it , either .
+1 director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier english-language movie , the overpraised elizabeth .

+1 a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism .
+1 the heat of the moment prevails . it cooks conduct in a low , smoky and inviting sizzle .
+1 while it regards 1967 as the key turning point of the 20th century , and returns again and again to images of dissidents in the streets , it's alarmingly current .

+1 a compelling spanish film about the withering effects of jealousy in the life of a young monarch whose sexual passion for her husband becomes an obsession .

-1 bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be .
-1 falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice .
-1 nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .
-1 thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired .
+1 a quiet , disquieting triumph .
-1 winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults .
-1 care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .
-1 this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
+1 an instance of an old dog not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick .
-1 it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .
-1 the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother .
+1 tony gayton's script doesn't give us anything we haven't seen before , but director d . j . caruso's grimy visual veneer and kilmer's absorbing performance increase the gravitational pull considerably .
-1 the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
+1 this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men .
+1 in spite of good housekeeping's unsavory characters and wwf mentality , this white trash war of the roses is a surprisingly engaging film .
-1 the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .
-1 slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot .
-1 stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .
-1 a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick .
-1 less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .
+1 a vivid , spicy footnote to history , and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish .
+1 there's back-stabbing , inter-racial desire and , most importantly , singing and dancing .
-1 to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .
-1 . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine .
+1 'like a child with an important message to tell . . . [skins'] faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty . '
-1 one long string of cliches .
-1 empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either .
+1 guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook , rattled , or rolled .
+1 an ambitious and moving but bleak film .
+1 a good thriller .
-1 banal and predictable .
-1 the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .
-1 this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie .
-1 i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy .
+1 while this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that's more interested in asking questions than in answering them .
+1 what it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness .
+1 the filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers .
+1 my wife's plotting is nothing special ; it's the delivery that matters here .
+1 together writer-director danny verete's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt .
+1 a conventional but heartwarming tale .
+1 the salton sea has moments of inspired humour , though every scrap is of the darkest variety .
+1 a touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by michel piccoli .
+1 its sheer dynamism is infectious .
-1 the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .
+1 this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences . . . and it's all the stronger because of it .
+1 it's got all the familiar bruckheimer elements , and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas .
+1 in xxx , diesel is that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners , and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep .
-1 this is no " waterboy ! "
-1 a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater .
+1 the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms . ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh's book trainspotting .
-1 'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree .
+1 a gripping drama .
-1 k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich .
-1 my precious new star wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag . . .
+1 its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads .
+1 tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth .
-1 one of the worst movies of the year . . . . watching it was painful .
-1 pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs .
+1 in addition to gluing you to the edge of your seat , changing lanes is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight .
+1 ahhhh . . . revenge is sweet !
+1 de oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by michel piccoli .
-1 too simple for its own good .
-1 friday after next is the kind of film that could only be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans .
-1 the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role .
+1 a film of quiet power .
-1 hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud .
-1 the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .
-1 the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .
+1 a perverse little truffle , dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy .
-1 rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring .
-1 behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise !
-1 loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .
-1 demme's loose approach kills the suspense .
-1 my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .
+1 plunges you into a reality that is , more often then not , difficult and sad , and then , without sentimentalizing it or denying its brutality , transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision .
-1 the big-screen scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison .
+1 affectionately reminds us that , in any language , the huge stuff in life can usually be traced back to the little things .
-1 [morgan] , judd and franklin can't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism .
-1 if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one .
+1 in adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns .
+1 the pleasures of super troopers may be fleeting , but they'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor .
-1 predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king .
-1 there's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever .
-1 maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul " full frontal " seems , well , contrived .
+1 expands the limits of what a film can be , taking us into the lives of women to whom we might not give a second look if we passed them on the street .
-1 any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .
+1 white oleander may leave you rolling your eyes in the dark , but that doesn't mean you won't like looking at it .
-1 it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy .
-1 too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot .
-1 mctiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious .
+1 filled with alexandre desplat's haunting and sublime music , the movie completely transfixes the audience .
+1 a tasty masala .
+1 a captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller .
+1 a sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work .
-1 all movie long , city by the sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast .
+1 though filmed partly in canada , paid in full has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the reagan years .
+1 the lion king was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago , but on imax it seems better , not just bigger .
-1 ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
+1 rare birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable .
-1 it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .
+1 the asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of jia with his family .
+1 eric byler's nuanced pic avoids easy sentiments and explanations . . .
-1 it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
-1 as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .
-1 it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , " look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! " but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .
-1 is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ?
-1 barely gets off the ground .
+1 never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man . the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive .
-1 feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .
-1 rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories .
+1 i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance .
-1 the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .
-1 it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations .
-1 by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing .
-1 there's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance .
+1 the fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad .
-1 a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .
-1 the film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture .
-1 it cannot be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . yes , dull .
+1 a deep and meaningful film .
+1 k-19 : the widowmaker is a great yarn .
+1 it may not be " last tango in paris " but . . .
+1 neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest attal and gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm .
-1 apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other .
+1 brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , haneke's portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt .
+1 a gem , captured in the unhurried , low-key style favored by many directors of the iranian new wave .
+1 thirteen conversations about one thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began .
+1 heaven is a haunting dramatization of a couple's moral ascension .
-1 this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
+1 a harrowing account of a psychological breakdown .
-1 it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary .
+1 . . . a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind .
-1 brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .
+1 a zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans ( but by no means all ) will have fun with .
+1 almodovar is an imaginative teacher of emotional intelligence in this engaging film about two men who discover what william james once called 'the gift of tears . '
+1 graced with the kind of social texture and realism that would be foreign in american teen comedies .
-1 like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless .
-1 the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .
+1 a rip-roaring comedy action fest that'll put hairs on your chest .
+1 it's not life-affirming — its vulgar and mean , but i liked it .
-1 a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special .
-1 the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot .
+1 at its best when the guarded , resentful betty and the manipulative yet needy margot are front and center .
-1 the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess's home video of their baby's birth .
-1 snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this .
-1 expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies .
-1 oozes condescension from every pore .
+1 [majidi] makes us think twice about immigrants we see around us every day .
+1 what one is left with , even after the most awful acts are committed , is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into your very bloodstream .
+1 beautifully observed , miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama .
+1 there is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when friel pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in williams is as visceral as a gut punch .
-1 i'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment .
+1 implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most american of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest hollywood document of all .
+1 generally , clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler , while happily killing 94 minutes .
+1 maryam is more timely now than ever .
-1 low rent from frame one .
+1 10 minutes into the film you'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away .
-1 the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut !
-1 there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version .
-1 feels familiar and tired .
+1 it helps that the central performers are experienced actors , and that they know their roles so well .
-1 hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story .
+1 a triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction !
+1 this breezy caper movie becomes a soulful , incisive meditation on the way we were , and the way we are .
-1 the structure the film takes may find matt damon and ben affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned .
-1 all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 .
+1 a well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone .
-1 done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment .
+1 a map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn with a master's steady stroke .
+1 there's something about a marching band that gets me where i live .
+1 a finely tuned mood piece , a model of menacing atmosphere .
-1 so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat .
+1 although olivier assayas' elegantly appointed period drama seems , at times , padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation . . . its three-hour running time plays closer to two .
-1 her fans walked out muttering words like " horrible " and " terrible , " but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero .
+1 its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there's no time to think about them anyway .
+1 the film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission . . . if " gory mayhem " is your idea of a good time .
+1 brims with passion : for words , for its eccentric , accident-prone characters , and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life .
-1 such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .
+1 qutting may be a flawed film , but it is nothing if not sincere .
+1 . . . tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character , an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope .
+1 the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one .
-1 the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .
+1 this is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio's absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed .
+1 touché !
-1 has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
-1 comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .
+1 it is quite a vision .
+1 it understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking .
-1 imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . the result might look like vulgar .
-1 the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on .
+1 taken outside the context of the current political climate ( see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! ) , the sum of all fears is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller .
-1 this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .
-1 the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .
+1 seeing seinfeld at home as he watches his own appearance on letterman with a clinical eye reminds you that the key to stand-up is to always make it look easy , even though the reality is anything but .
+1 more of the same from taiwanese auteur tsai ming-liang , which is good news to anyone who's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director's previous films .
+1 thanks to the château's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises .
+1 evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made mamet's " house of games " and last fall's " heist " so much fun .
+1 the sentimental cliches mar an otherwise excellent film . a powerful performance from mel gibson and a brutal 90-minute battle sequence that does everything but issue you a dog-tag and an m-16 .
+1 i was amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise .
-1 the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
+1 the film does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard .
-1 despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like [seinfeld's] revered tv show , about pretty much nothing .
+1 has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a " 2 " at the end of its title .
-1 a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable .
-1 . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet .
-1 with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp .
+1 the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard .
-1 if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump .
-1 abysmally pathetic
+1 the cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story .
+1 ong's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent chinese immigrant's experiences in new york city .
+1 formuliac , but fun .
-1 watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it .
-1 the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse .
-1 shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting .
+1 some of the most inventive silliness you are likely to witness in a movie theatre for some time .
-1 the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john .
+1 tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable .
+1 an important movie , a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values .
+1 tsai ming-liang's ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being .
-1 not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at .
+1 the transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb
-1 'linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project . . . '
+1 windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live .
+1 while general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music , they'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds .
+1 for movie lovers as well as opera lovers , tosca is a real treat .
-1 pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal .
-1 drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness .
-1 the central story lacks punch .
+1 is this love or is it masochism ? binoche makes it interesting trying to find out .
-1 wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award .
+1 very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience .
-1 the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design .
+1 with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , hélène angel is definitely a director to watch .
+1 the story is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution .
+1 there are a couple of things that elevate " glory " above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall .
-1 has its charming quirks and its dull spots .
-1 i have no problem with " difficult " movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out . but first , you have to give the audience a reason to <b>want</b> to put for that effort , and " i
-1 `hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere .
-1 the story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare , and the romance with ryder is puzzling .
-1 dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery .
-1 a wildly inconsistent emotional experience .
+1 it's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic .
+1 sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor , and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do .
+1 it strikes hardest… when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill .
+1 devos delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower .
-1 don't even bother to rent this on video .
-1 very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
+1 as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts , which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project .
-1 at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer .
-1 told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .
-1 fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix .
-1 there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?
+1 she's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness .
+1 director nalin pan doesn't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other . he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works . no question .
-1 the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .
+1 filmmaker stacy peralta has a flashy editing style that doesn't always jell with sean penn's monotone narration , but he respects the material without sentimentalizing it .
+1 [the film] tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end , it's impossible to ascertain whether the film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful .
+1 hatosy . . . portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue .
-1 this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks .
+1 cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing .
+1 splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity .
-1 imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring .
-1 [a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .
-1 what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad .
-1 a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .
+1 a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation .
+1 buy popcorn . take nothing seriously and enjoy the ride .
+1 personal velocity has a no-frills docu-dogma plainness , yet miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire . she boxes these women's souls right open for us .
+1 pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins .
-1 the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' .
-1 the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness .
-1 slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
+1 the pianist is the film roman polanski may have been born to make .
-1 eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you don't care who fires the winning shot .
-1 the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .
-1 the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure .
+1 making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror .
+1 steven spielberg brings us another masterpiece
+1 topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs .
-1 its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers .
+1 a fast-moving and remarkable film that appears destined to become a landmark in japanese animation .
-1 in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach .
+1 my goodness , queen latifah has a lot to offer and she seemed to have no problem flaunting her natural gifts . she must have a very strong back .
-1 . . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else .
-1 i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad .
+1 its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time .

-1 mr . goyer's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .
-1 if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way .

-1 without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking .
+1 there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit .
+1 the modern remake of dumas's story is long on narrative and ( too ) short on action .

+1 this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire .
+1 one of the year's best films , featuring an oscar-worthy performance by julianne moore .
+1 . . . has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they're ghosts imagining themselves as alive . it's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its " men in a sardine can " warped logic .
+1 dazzles with its fully-written characters , its determined stylishness ( which always relates to characters and story ) and johnny dankworth's best soundtrack in years .
+1 neither the funniest film that eddie murphy nor robert de niro has ever made , showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while . before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway .

+1 what 'dumb and dumber' would have been without the vulgarity and with an intelligent , life-affirming script .

+1 a film about a young man finding god that is accessible and touching to the marrow .
-1 ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms . paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability .
-1 a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .
+1 like leon , it's frustrating and still oddly likable .
+1 like shrek , spirit's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world .

+1 there's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers .
-1 the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
-1 a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional .
-1 for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam .

+1 a movie of technical skill and rare depth of intellect and feeling .
-1 [toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material .
-1 cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail's pace .
+1 the quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by rachel griffiths .

-1 an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .

+1 it ain't art , by a long shot , but unlike last year's lame musketeer , this dumas adaptation entertains .
+1 the creative animation work may not look as fully 'rendered' as pixar's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree .
-1 the film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables .
-1 though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .
-1 fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .
+1 if you like blood , guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though . . . you will likely enjoy this monster .

-1 woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them .
+1 the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms . ambrose .
+1 grainy photography mars an otherwise delightful comedy of errors .
+1 cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent's days

-1 this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen .
+1 by turns fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic .
-1 a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art .
+1 you live the mood rather than savour the story .
-1 remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago .
-1 all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto .
-1 a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line .
-1 the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .
-1 j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl .
-1 has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness .
-1 wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited .
-1 for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution .
+1 a worthy entry into a very difficult genre .
-1 in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie .
+1 it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media . . . to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks .
-1 [a] rather thinly-conceived movie .
+1 stevens' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls .
-1 the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .
+1 grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length
-1 the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much .
+1 eight legged freaks is clever and funny , is amused by its special effects , and leaves you feeling like you've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer .
+1 an intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time .
-1 master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .
+1 the smartest bonehead comedy of the summer .
+1 nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure .
+1 it's not just a feel-good movie , it's a feel movie . you feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off , but in the end , you feel alive - which is what they did .
+1 [reaches] wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair .

+1 connoisseurs of chinese film will be pleased to discover that tian's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus .
+1 this time out , [sade] is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful , responsible and reckless , idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested .
-1 however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release .
-1 i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen .
-1 it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) .
-1 does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .
-1 for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .
+1 majidi's direction has never been smoother or more confident .
+1 the overall effect is awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude .
+1 it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work .
+1 you may leave the theater with more questions than answers , but darned if your toes won't still be tapping .
-1 an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense .
-1 comes off like a bad imitation of the bard .
+1 affable if not timeless , like mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids .
-1 director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle .
+1 a stunning piece of visual poetry that will , hopefully , be remembered as one of the most important stories to be told in australia's film history .
+1 an intimate , good-humored ethnic comedy like numerous others but cuts deeper than expected .
-1 zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .
+1 a muted freak-out
-1 consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
+1 while not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy .
+1 it's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn . nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining .
+1 hollywood ending is not show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty nonetheless .
-1 we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments .
+1 boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun .

-1 despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow , the weight of water is oppressively heavy .
+1 while it's nothing we haven't seen before from murphy , i spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it's more than a worthwhile effort .
-1 it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .
-1 there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them .
+1 it's immensely ambitious , different than anything that's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it's trying to do .

-1 it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .
+1 when twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives , hard-driving narcissism is a given , but what a world we'd live in if argento's hollywood counterparts . . . had this much imagination and nerve .

+1 an irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale .
-1 been there done that .

-1 nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives .
-1 the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .

+1 what could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman's tragic odyssey .
-1 a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness .

-1 the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters .
+1 a perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little lilo & stitch had in spades -- charisma .

-1 'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . '

-1 as it stands it's an opera movie for the buffs .
-1 just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .

-1 they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .
+1 a thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action . still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences .

+1 an enormously entertaining movie , like nothing we've ever seen before , and yet completely familiar .
-1 if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea .
-1 at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii .

-1 an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach

+1 thanks to scott's charismatic roger and eisenberg's sweet nephew , roger dodger is one of the most compelling variations on in the company of men .
+1 provide[s] nail-biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology-of-the-moment technique or pretentious dialogue .
+1 quiet , adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year . . . a true study , a film with a questioning heart and mind that isn't afraid to admit it doesn't have all the answers .
+1 this charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed .
+1 perhaps not since nelson eddy crooned his indian love call to jeanette macdonald has there been a movie so unabashedly canadian , not afraid to risk american scorn or disinterest .

+1 what begins as a film in the tradition of the graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant .

+1 [reno] delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion .

-1 scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .

-1 a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .
+1 as allen's execution date closes in , the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator david presson .

-1 despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it .

-1 a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .
+1 it may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of weekend and two or three things i know about her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ?
-1 at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance .
-1 all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .
-1 as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired .

-1 'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue .
-1 holden caulfield did it better .

-1 a thriller without a lot of thrills .
+1 everything that has to do with yvan and charlotte , and everything that has to do with yvan's rambunctious , jewish sister and her non-jew husband , feels funny and true .
+1 films about loss , grief and recovery are pretty valuable these days . seen in that light , moonlight mile should strike a nerve in many .
-1 accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license .
-1 an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either .
-1 [t]here's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them .
+1 faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , " a walk to remember " succeeds through sincerity .

-1 all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it's spread too thin .
+1 the picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it's no glance . it's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing .

+1 not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral--and , hence , more chillingly effective .

+1 en sí mismo el rey león es un espectáculo digno de contemplarse en cine , dvd o en su soberbio montaje teatral ; pero el hacerlo en la pantalla imax es una experiencia colosal .
-1 howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they're often undone by howard's self-conscious attempts to find a 'literary' filmmaking style to match his subject .
+1 ok arthouse . the power of this script , and the performances that come with it , is that the whole damned thing didn't get our moral hackles up .

-1 traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichés that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill .

+1 director peter kosminsky gives these women a forum to demonstrate their acting 'chops' and they take full advantage .
-1 high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd .
+1 the film occasionally tries the viewer's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story .
-1 historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
+1 old people will love this movie , and i mean that in the nicest possible way : last orders will touch the heart of anyone old enough to have earned a 50-year friendship .
+1 there's something auspicious , and daring , too , about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like steven spielberg to follow a . i . with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority .

-1 the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut .

+1 some body will take you places you haven't been , and also places you have .
-1 men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . .
-1 a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow's car .
-1 bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness .

-1 meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull .
-1 seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof .

-1 . . . silly humbuggery . . .
-1 lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis .

-1 hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound .
-1 unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .
-1 it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype .
+1 critics need a good laugh , too , and this too-extreme-for-tv rendition of the notorious mtv show delivers the outrageous , sickening , sidesplitting goods in steaming , visceral heaps .

+1 a movie that will thrill you , touch you and make you laugh as well .

-1 juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile .
+1 flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others , 65-year-old jack nicholson could be looking at his 12th oscar nomination by proving that he's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary .
+1 though it's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working-class .
+1 . . . a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs . it is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual
+1 daily struggles and simple pleasures usurp the preaching message so that , by the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails .
+1 an animation landmark as monumental as disney's 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs .
+1 my oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie .
-1 the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .
+1 this odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton's ever-watchful gaze -- and it's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one .

+1 i admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending .
-1 to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree .
-1 while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier .

+1 hashiguchi vividly captures the way young japanese live now , chafing against their culture's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse .

-1 really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length .

-1 the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts .
-1 the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .
+1 must be seen to be believed .

+1 [ramsay] visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor .

+1 leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema . he allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue . this method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here .
+1 the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture . much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride .

-1 the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that's where this film should have remained .
+1 a complex psychological drama about a father who returns to his son's home after decades away .
+1 you emerge dazed , confused as to whether you've seen pornography or documentary .

+1 brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade .
-1 it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd .
-1 obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .

-1 how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $100 million on this ?
-1 the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting .
+1 with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives .
+1 uplifting as only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be , and among the best films of the year .
+1 colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory .
+1 the unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality .
-1 too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets .
-1 . . . a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional .
-1 skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .
-1 most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant .
+1 behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one can't help but think he'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art .
+1 is it a total success ? no . is it something any true film addict will want to check out ? you bet .
-1 an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting .
-1 in the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director roger kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of . . . outrageous gags .

+1 offers a guilt-free trip into feel-good territory .
-1 if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball .
+1 many a parent and their teen ( or preteen ) kid could bond while watching a walk to remember . so could young romantics out on a date .

-1 a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
+1 there's a lot to recommend read my lips .
+1 [raimi's] matured quite a bit with spider-man , even though it's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you'll ever see .
+1 lovely and poignant . puts a human face on a land most westerners are unfamiliar with .
+1 from the big giant titles of the opening credits to elmer bernstein's perfectly melodic score , haynes gets just about everything right .
-1 a horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness .
-1 it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving .
+1 an extraordinary dramatic experience .
-1 guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others don't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .
+1 the film's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth .
-1 the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack .
+1 griffiths proves she's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession .
-1 a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort .
+1 a superbly acted and funny/gritty fable of the humanizing of one woman at the hands of the unseen forces of fate .
-1 like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour .
-1 aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me .
-1 in the book-on-tape market , the film of " the kid stays in the picture " would be an abridged edition
+1 a rollicking ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending .
+1 it's a day at the beach -- with air conditioning and popcorn .
-1 director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks .
-1 what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once .
-1 a simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something .
+1 here's a british flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility , yet just as determined to entertain you .
-1 the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest .
+1 the story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing sayles dialogue .
+1 binoche and magimel are perfect in these roles .
-1 it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable .
+1 unpretentious , charming , quirky , original
+1 smith finds amusing juxtapositions that justify his exercise .
-1 a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is .
-1 an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product .
+1 it's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads . it's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process .
-1 this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .
-1 it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
-1 the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .

-1 at best , cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience .
-1 the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned .
+1 a gripping documentary that reveals how deep the antagonism lies in war-torn jerusalem .
-1 the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .
+1 the increasingly diverse french director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history .
-1 if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie .
-1 malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .

-1 too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .
+1 a thought-provoking picture .
+1 heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on petter næss' delicate , clever direction . . . and a wonderful , imaginative script by axel hellstenius .
-1 instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone .
-1 a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) .
+1 [a] devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid holocaust drama .
+1 at its best , which occurs often , michael moore's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the 'are we a sick society ? ' journalism of the 1960s .
-1 [johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers .
+1 [chaiken's] talent lies in an evocative , accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively , convincing dialogue she creates for her characters .
+1 star wars is back in a major way .
-1 you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal .
-1 it believes it's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile .
+1 we can see the wheels turning , and we might resent it sometimes , but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer .
+1 it's quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer .
-1 it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .
+1 bittersweet comedy/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable italian guys .
+1 sleek and arty .
+1 mr . parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom .

+1 funny and touching .
-1 go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .
-1 hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired .
+1 as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes weren't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create .
+1 a rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd .
+1 reign of fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies .
+1 most impressive , though , is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters' emotional wounds .
+1 like all of egoyan's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious .
+1 full of surprises .
-1 the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it .
-1 however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny .
-1 sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation .

-1 frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music .
+1 a gentle , compassionate drama about grief and healing .
+1 a movie that sends you out of the theater feeling like you've actually spent time living in another community .
-1 desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
+1 the two leads , nearly perfect in their roles , bring a heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie .
-1 a full-frontal attack on audience patience .
+1 you have enough finely tuned acting to compensate for the movie's failings .
-1 a glossy knock-off of a b-movie revenge flick .

+1 a cautionary tale about the grandiosity of a college student who sees himself as impervious to a fall .
+1 neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula .
-1 if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .
+1 munch's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters . he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities . his scenes are short and often unexpected .
+1 the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun .
-1 an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .
-1 all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness .
+1 mr . polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival .
+1 it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future .
-1 a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .
+1 a fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie .
+1 sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now . . . and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors .
-1 wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .
+1 call this the full monty on ice , the underdog sports team formula redux .
+1 the film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome . and it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen .
+1 beautifully produced .
+1 strange it is , but delightfully so .
+1 anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film .
+1 this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography .
+1 as green-guts monster movies go , it's a beaut .
+1 an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch .
-1 like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .
-1 a wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching .
+1 gangster no . 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults .
+1 trapped won't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness .
-1 the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
-1 but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative .
+1 if there's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it's in projects like the ( unfortunately r-rated ) paid .
-1 phoned-in business as usual .
+1 with an expressive face reminiscent of gong li and a vivid personality like zhang ziyi's , dong stakes out the emotional heart of happy .
-1 the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short .
+1 good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat .
-1 dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .
+1 the spaniel-eyed jean reno infuses hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart .
+1 a gorgeous , high-spirited musical from india that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama .
+1 although frailty fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work .
+1 about a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological .
-1 a decidedly mixed bag .
+1 this is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , so original is its content , look , and style .
-1 a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .
-1 this isn't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it's the cliffsnotes with pages missing .
-1 if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) .
-1 the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .
-1 directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .

+1 you come away from his film overwhelmed , hopeful and , perhaps paradoxically , illuminated .
+1 there's so much to look at in metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles .

+1 the concert footage is stirring , the recording sessions are intriguing , and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers .
-1 to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .
-1 the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
+1 the recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom .
-1 amidst the action , the script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the " other side of the story . "
-1 there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale .
-1 a well acted and well intentioned snoozer .
+1 <em>ash wednesday</em> is not edward burns' best film , but it is a good and ambitious film . and it marks him as one of the most interesting writer/directors working today .
-1 despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .
+1 it's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire !
-1 the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .
+1 this film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion .
+1 sweet and memorable film .
+1 with each of her three protagonists , miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path .
-1 a blair witch- style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast .
-1 most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .
+1 the movie is well crafted , and well executed . if you're paying attention , the " big twists " are pretty easy to guess - but that doesn't make the movie any less entertaining .
-1 . . . a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge . . . the filmmakers' paws , sad to say , were all over this " un-bear-able " project !
-1 the thrill is ( long ) gone .
-1 the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo .
+1 its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing .
-1 philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .
+1 this is an extraordinary film , not least because it is japanese and yet feels universal .
-1 leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion .
-1 deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .
-1 this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
-1 that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .
-1 moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact .
+1 an enjoyably half-wit remake of the venerable italian comedy big deal on madonna street .
+1 who needs mind-bending drugs when they can see this , the final part of the 'qatsi' trilogy , directed by godfrey reggio , with music by philip glass ?
-1 it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese .
+1 a chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign's end , an extended publicity department .
+1 for anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man's response to stroke , ram dass : fierce grace is worth seeking out .
+1 dolgin and franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a vietnamese-born youngster who eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-american girl with a brand new name in southern tennessee .
-1 uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .
+1 children may not understand everything that happens -- i'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted .
-1 . . . [a] strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense .
-1 as pedestrian as they come .
-1 for a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed 'surprises . '
+1 the combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives italian for beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic .
+1 smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise .
+1 some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious , but restrained and subtle storytelling , and fine performances make this delicate coming-of-age tale a treat .
+1 the most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from portugal .
+1 the laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while russell and dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them .
+1 a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , read my lips is an original . this is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent .
+1 writer/director joe carnahan's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic .
-1 pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two .
-1 a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels .
-1 we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .
-1 often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .
+1 this story still seems timely and important . and there's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after greene's story ends .
-1 the chateau . . . is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters .
+1 a raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted korean american stand-up's i'm the one that i want .
-1 any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .
+1 sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed martha as her heart begins to open .
+1 going to this movie is a little like chewing whale blubber - it's an acquired taste that takes time to enjoy , but it's worth it , even if it does take 3 hours to get through .
+1 ofrece una buena oportunidad de cultura ( aunque sea condensada ) que bien vale la pena aprovechar .

-1 fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess .
+1 you may be captivated , as i was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear .
+1 swimming is above all about a young woman's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds .
+1 an appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles .
-1 the château would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens .
-1 'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience .

+1 a refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market .
-1 the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters .
-1 a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .
+1 droll caper-comedy remake of " big deal on madonna street " that's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate " bellini " begins to look like a " real kaputschnik . "
+1 a densely constructed , highly referential film , and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among jean-luc godard's finest work .
-1 the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates .
+1 tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure .
-1 the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .
+1 a story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously . it is also beautifully acted .
-1 the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered .
-1 at the one-hour mark , herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion .

-1 the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal .
+1 young hanks and fisk , who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents , bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work .
-1 in the end , there isn't much to it .
-1 directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name

+1 an entertaining , if ultimately minor , thriller .
-1 a major waste . . . generic .
+1 light the candles , bring out the cake and don't fret about the calories because there's precious little substance in birthday girl -- it's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat .
+1 the movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end .
+1 as i settled into my world war ii memories , i found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances .
+1 even when it drags , we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking
+1 the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor .
-1 egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .
+1 the ending feels at odds with the rest of the film .
-1 like a soft drink that's been sitting open too long : it's too much syrup and not enough fizz .
-1 take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets .
+1 williams plays sy , another of his open-faced , smiling madmen , like the killer in insomnia . he does this so well you don't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role .
+1 it's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart .
+1 even if the ride's a little bumpy , with a final lap that's all too suspiciously smooth , you gotta give director roger michell , best known for the superfluous notting hill , credit for trying .
-1 instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?
+1 its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces . . . are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half . still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental .
+1 hey , who else needs a shower ?
-1 other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst .
-1 witless and utterly pointless .
-1 this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story .
+1 a highly spirited , imaginative kid's movie that broaches neo-augustinian theology : is god stuck in heaven because he's afraid of his best-known creation ?
+1 a warm but realistic meditation on friendship , family and affection .
+1 it would be disingenuous to call reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex . this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn .
+1 it is ridiculous , of course . . . but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness .
-1 a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash .
-1 a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers .
-1 sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony .
-1 john carlen's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling .
+1 satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity .
+1 jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama .
-1 . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .
+1 i don't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version . but i do .
+1 the story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me .
+1 contrasting the original ringu with the current americanized adaptation is akin to comparing the evil dead with evil dead ii
-1 the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing .
+1 death to smoochy is often very funny , but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito's misanthropic vision .
-1 despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .
+1 like its two predecessors , 1983's koyaanisqatsi and 1988's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever .
-1 rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical .
+1 leigh's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other .
+1 twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record .
-1 the hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone .
+1 an involving , inspirational drama that sometimes falls prey to its sob-story trappings .
+1 it's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty .
-1 this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does .
+1 [ " safe conduct " ] is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage . viva le resistance !
+1 finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less .
-1 barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time
+1 some may choose to interpret the film's end as hopeful or optimistic but i think payne is after something darker .
-1 i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .
-1 it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .
+1 tadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother .
-1 ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
+1 a well-made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non-reactionary morality .
+1 leguizamo and jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb .
-1 the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .
+1 manages to accomplish what few sequels can -- it equals the original and in some ways even betters it .
+1 most of the things that made the original men in black such a pleasure are still there .
+1 more than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again .
-1 davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine .
+1 . . . a light , yet engrossing piece . lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , jewish grandmother and subject – taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history .
+1 there are some movies that hit you from the first scene and you know it's going to be a trip . igby goes down is one of those movies .
-1 the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions .
-1 just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?
-1 a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie .
-1 a lame comedy .
+1 a disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an alice in wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of tv's big brother .
-1 the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
-1 in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .
+1 melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting , and always a beauty to behold .
+1 a stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of beauty and the beast and 1930s horror films
+1 this is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man .
+1 bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability .
+1 a comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising .
+1 robert harmon's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in -the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film's thick shadows .
+1 fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn .
-1 ruh-roh ! romething's really wrong with this ricture !
+1 nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable , warm water may well be the year's best and most unpredictable comedy .
+1 with dirty deeds , david caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen .
-1 the innocence of holiday cheer ain't what it used to be .
-1 time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .
+1 the wanton slipperiness of * corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art .
-1 how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?
-1 it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor .
+1 it challenges , this nervy oddity , like modern art should .
-1 this is a truly , truly bad movie .
-1 the story really has no place to go since simone is not real—she can't provide any conflict .
+1 passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly . . .
+1 rarely have i seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart .
+1 it's another retelling of alexandre dumas' classic . why ? who knows , but it works under the direction of kevin reynolds .
-1 too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .
-1 far too clever by half , howard's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .
-1 watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost .
+1 it's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters .
+1 just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years .
-1 claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .
+1 ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness .
-1 watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff .
+1 directors brett morgen and nanette burstein have put together a bold biographical fantasia .
+1 a fiercely clever and subtle film , capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries .
+1 a passionately inquisitive film determined to uncover the truth and hopefully inspire action .
+1 [d]espite its familiar subject matter , ice age is consistently amusing and engrossing . . .
-1 if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be " how does steven seagal come across these days ? " or maybe " how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ?
-1 a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse .
+1 'barbershop " is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story .
+1 for most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche .
-1 a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged .
-1 [l]ame and unnecessary .
-1 for a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new hal hartley movie to pore over , no such thing is a big letdown .
-1 most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
-1 'lovely and amazing , ' unhappily , is neither . . . excessively strained and contrived .
-1 since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things .
-1 so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .
+1 if this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then the grey zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle .
-1 at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .
-1 the photographer's show-don't-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject .
-1 watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart .
+1 a sports movie with action that's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it .
-1 even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash .
-1 . . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges .
+1 it's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter .
+1 asks what truth can be discerned from non-firsthand experience , and specifically questions cinema's capability for recording truth .
-1 try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie .
-1 another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie .
-1 if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid .
-1 a plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .
+1 shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic .
+1 less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling ( though no less horrifying for it ) .
+1 a smart , sassy and exceptionally charming romantic comedy .
+1 there's no denying that burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him .
+1 kaufman and jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing .
+1 opening with some contrived banter , cliches and some loose ends , the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half .
-1 this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow .
+1 for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped . for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped .
+1 a film that will enthrall the whole family .
+1 part of the film's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz .
-1 i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay .
+1 this is dicaprio's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year .
+1 an oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion .
-1 this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids . parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
-1 [a] mess .
+1 it pulls the rug out from under you , just when you're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction .
-1 goes on and on to the point of nausea .
-1 the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .
-1 the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch .
-1 the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare .
-1 the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter .
-1 does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon .
+1 . . . rogers's mouth never stops shut about the war between the sexes and how to win the battle .
+1 it's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest .
-1 partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .
+1 this time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it's still a rollicking good time for the most part .
-1 at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow .
-1 at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential .
-1 for a film about explosions and death and spies , " ballistic : ecks vs . sever " seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .
+1 worth catching for griffiths' warm and winning central performance .
+1 director lee has a true cinematic knack , but it's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve .
+1 one of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm .
+1 an entertaining , if somewhat standardized , action movie .
-1 romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect .
+1 as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner .
-1 there's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .
+1 a very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be .
+1 with elements cribbed from lang's metropolis , welles' kane , and eisenstein's potemkin , the true wonder of rintarô's metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own .
+1 beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling . . . recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly .
-1 this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .
-1 the name says it all . jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set .
-1 labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .
+1 together , tok and o orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death . in the process , they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema .
-1 essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . .
+1 genuinely unnerving .
+1 richard gere and diane lane put in fine performances as does french actor oliver martinez .
-1 too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel .
+1 somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes .
-1 although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film .
+1 goldmember is funny enough to justify the embarrassment of bringing a barf bag to the moviehouse .
-1 so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag .
+1 . . . a triumph of emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking .
-1 whether it's the worst movie of 2002 , i can't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
-1 if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .
+1 the film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political blair witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen .
-1 loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin .
-1 shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was .
-1 a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .
-1 the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .
-1 it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : " got aids yet ? "
+1 crammed with incident , and bristles with passion and energy .
+1 a creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man . . . about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy .
+1 a fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard . . . and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels .
+1 bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake .
-1 not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs .
-1 kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities .
-1 this ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it .
+1 as chilling and fascinating as philippe mora's modern hitler-study , snide and prejudice .
-1 places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
+1 arguably the best script that besson has written in years .
+1 it's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama .
-1 unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , impostor is opening today at a theater near you .
-1 there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it .
-1 stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros . -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green's half-hearted movie career .
+1 stands as a document of what it felt like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 .
-1 alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl .
+1 fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way . . . that feels very human and very true to life .
+1 but tongue-in-cheek preposterousness has always been part of for the most part wilde's droll whimsy helps " being earnest " overcome its weaknesses and parker's creative interference . . .
+1 " catch me " feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark .
+1 the film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved . . . this makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture .
-1 " the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store "
+1 noyce's film is contemplative and mournfully reflective .
-1 the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .
-1 boy oh boy , it's a howler .
+1 . . . a weak , manipulative , pencil-thin story that is miraculously able to entertain anyway .
-1 even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .
+1 it's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep .
-1 what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .
+1 biggie and tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame .
+1 it's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be . but it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds .
+1 it's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio's animated classics .
-1 . . . grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces .
-1 every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv .
+1 offers much to enjoy . . . and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends .
-1 it's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .
+1 [gosling's] combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character .
+1 mel gibson fights the good fight in vietnam in director randall wallace's flag-waving war flick with a core of decency .
-1 no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .
+1 the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by .
-1 the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .
+1 the script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar .
-1 much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .
-1 while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
-1 as the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . i have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short .
+1 a respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films . . . cross over to a more mainstream audience .
+1 beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm .
+1 " the emperor's new clothes " begins with a simple plan . . . . well , at least that's the plan .
+1 brosnan is more feral in this film than i've seen him before and halle berry does her best to keep up with him .
-1 much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date .
-1 nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .
+1 a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture .
-1 uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .
+1 a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african-american's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle .
-1 a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine .
+1 devos and cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension , while never really vocalized , is palpable .
-1 a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .
+1 . . . certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes . but something seems to be missing . a sense of real magic , perhaps .
+1 allen's funniest and most likeable movie in years .
-1 herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance .
+1 the movie should be credited with remembering his victims .
+1 [barry] gives assassin a disquieting authority .
-1 the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .
+1 a winning and wildly fascinating work .
-1 faultlessly professional but finally slight .
+1 while the story's undeniably hard to follow , iwai's gorgeous visuals seduce .
+1 the farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one .
-1 it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success .
-1 the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi .
+1 many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and i don't think that a . c . will help this movie one bit .
+1 you don't have to be an especially tough grader to give a charitable b-minus to the emperor's club .
+1 a fine production with splendid singing by angela gheorghiu , ruggero raimondi , and roberto alagna .
-1 the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .
-1 earnest but heavy-handed .
+1 at a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons , it's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form's history .
+1 wang xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men .
+1 i'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled , but , for those with at least a minimal appreciation of woolf and clarissa dalloway , the hours represents two of those well spent .
-1 the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died .
-1 shouldn't have been allowed to use the word " new " in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .
+1 sweet home alabama isn't going to win any academy awards , but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts .
-1 little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
+1 with youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast .
-1 troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal .
+1 a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies .
+1 a different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man lost in its midst .
-1 no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story .
-1 where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .
+1 what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point .
+1 now as a former gong show addict , i'll admit it , my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show .

-1 unless you're a fanatic , the best advice is : 'scooby' don't .
+1 schütte's dramatic snapshot of the artist three days before his death offers an interesting bit of speculation as to the issues brecht faced as his life drew to a close .
+1 a reasonably entertaining sequel to 1994's surprise family hit that may strain adult credibility .
+1 fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal .
-1 a feeble tootsie knockoff .
-1 fails to bring as much to the table .
+1 forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of friday-night excitement and milla power .
+1 can be viewed as pure composition and form -- film as music
-1 both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told .
+1 brian tufano's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special .
+1 it is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs .
+1 infidelity drama is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by diane lane .
-1 forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this won't seem like such a bore .
-1 . . . expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape .
+1 gently humorous and touching .
+1 a remarkably alluring film set in the constrictive eisenhower era about one suburban woman's yearning in the face of a loss that shatters her cheery and tranquil suburban life .
+1 its maker , steven spielberg , hasn't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping indiana jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray .
+1 it's soulful and unslick , and that's apparently just what [aniston] has always needed to grow into a movie career .
+1 it's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again .
-1 verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .
+1 dense , exhilarating documentary .
+1 for the most part , it's a work of incendiary genius , steering clear of knee-jerk reactions and quick solutions .
-1 no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised .
-1 there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate .
-1 lawrence should stick to his day job . he's a better actor than a standup comedian .
+1 in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters — damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .
-1 this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens . . . or if it were subtler . . . or if it had a sense of humor .
+1 that the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin's film serves up with style and empathy .
-1 a not-so-divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood with a hefty helping of re-fried green tomatoes .
+1 writer-director's mehta's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture , the intoxicating masala , of cultures and film genres .
+1 impossible as it may sound , this film's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .
-1 hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .
-1 for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor .
-1 what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial .
+1 you wouldn't want to live waydowntown , but it is a hilarious place to visit .
+1 light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time .
+1 an exhilarating futuristic thriller-noir , minority report twists the best of technology around a gripping story , delivering a riveting , pulse intensifying escapist adventure of the first order
+1 what makes salton sea surprisingly engrossing is that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion .
-1 a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground .
-1 it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn .
-1 hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes .
-1 several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in " unfaithful . " why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me .
+1 where bowling for columbine is at its most valuable is in its examination of america's culture of fear as a root cause of gun violence .
-1 the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood .
+1 workmanlike , maybe , but still a film with all the elements that made the other three great , scary times at the movies .
-1 the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks .
+1 it's a very valuable film . . .
-1 i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject .
-1 the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess .
-1 personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces .
-1 it's an awfully derivative story .
+1 hands down the year's most thought-provoking film . but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship .
-1 the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors .
+1 the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth .
-1 despite the premise of a good story . . . it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .
-1 this tuxedo . . . should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .
-1 it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .
+1 it may seem long at 110 minutes if you're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert .
-1 a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess .
+1 russian ark is a new treasure of the hermitage .
-1 it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile .
+1 the charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film's problems .
+1 digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world .
-1 slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .
+1 jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot .
-1 anemic chronicle of money grubbing new yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups .
-1 in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .
+1 efteriades gives the neighborhood -- scenery , vibe and all -- the cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug .
-1 the emperor's club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but . . .
-1 it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism .
-1 i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year .
+1 barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful .
-1 the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
-1 [e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism .
-1 gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable .
-1 in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .
-1 predictably melodramatic .
-1 something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
+1 the performances are an absolute joy .
-1 there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .
+1 a pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties .
+1 complex , affecting and uniquely almodóvar , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong .
+1 changing lanes is an anomaly for a hollywood movie ; it's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say .
+1 the performances are remarkable .
-1 a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [besson's] earlier work .
-1 for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league .
-1 comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief .
+1 miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet .
-1 all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .
-1 shallow , noisy and pretentious .
-1 becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring .
+1 those with an interest in new or singular sorts of film experiences will find what time is it there ? well worth the time .
+1 now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism .
-1 the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows .
+1 another entertaining romp from robert rodriguez .
+1 you'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it .

-1 de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back .
-1 the master of disguise represents adam sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe .
-1 all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat .
+1 pull[s] off the rare trick of recreating not only the look of a certain era , but also the feel .
+1 a slick , engrossing melodrama .
-1 while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her .
+1 from both a great and a terrible story , mr . nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience .

+1 although it lacks the detail of the book , the film does pack some serious suspense .
-1 it's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly .
-1 this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray .
-1 it's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant .
-1 [director] byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one .
-1 potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .
+1 a worthwhile documentary , whether you're into rap or not , even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll .
-1 a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation .
+1 using an endearing cast , writer/director dover kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships , both sexual and kindred .
+1 trades run-of-the-mill revulsion for extreme unease .
+1 despite its floating narrative , this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film .
-1 the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one .
+1 . . . a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy . . .
+1 though writer/director bart freundlich's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup's anchoring performance .
-1 feel bad for king , who's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who's shot himself in the foot .
+1 this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever .
+1 that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults .
+1 one of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time .
+1 both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy , what time is it there ? may prove to be [tsai's] masterpiece .
-1 it bites hard .
+1 funny , sexy , devastating and incurably romantic .
-1 it's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake .
-1 a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz .
-1 ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue .
+1 some movies blend together as they become distant memories . mention " solaris " five years from now and i'm sure those who saw it will have an opinion to share .
-1 . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work .
+1 andy garcia enjoys one of his richest roles in years and mick jagger gives his best movie performance since , well , performance .
-1 with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins .
+1 if you can swallow its absurdities and crudities lagaan really is enormously good fun .
+1 fans of the animated wildlife adventure show will be in warthog heaven ; others need not necessarily apply .
-1 a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .
+1 a special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento . . .

-1 sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it .
+1 if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing .

-1 la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , rápidamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible
+1 a riveting story well told .
-1 nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows .
-1 sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .
+1 there is greatness here .
-1 less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .
+1 go see it and enjoy .
+1 from blushing to gushing---imamura squirts the screen in ‘warm water under a red bridge'
+1 an older cad instructs a younger lad in zen and the art of getting laid in this prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy .
+1 your children will be occupied for 72 minutes .
+1 this is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them .

+1 by the standards of knucklehead swill , the hot chick is pretty damned funny .
-1 the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament .

-1 the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart .
+1 the last kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of my big fat greek wedding , but its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact .
+1 " extreme ops " exceeds expectations . good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography .
+1 hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile ( emphasized here ) accent the humor of wilson's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness .

-1 the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand .
+1 tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point .
+1 from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times .
+1 disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids' books to the screen . . . tuck everlasting is a little of both .
-1 watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms .
+1 the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people .
-1 on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .
-1 how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ?

-1 overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper .
+1 a stylish thriller .
-1 just not campy enough
-1 it is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .
-1 . . . a confusing drudgery .
+1 open-minded kids -- kids who read , kids who dream -- will be comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny .
-1 like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest .
+1 a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling--but unquestionably alive .
+1 based on a devilishly witty script by heather mcgowan and niels mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters
-1 you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .

-1 full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
-1 this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .
+1 a sweet-tempered comedy that forgoes the knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies .
+1 the kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you .
-1 strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression .
+1 bravo for history rewritten , and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love .
-1 slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious .
-1 sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .
+1 long after you leave justine , you'll be wondering what will happen to her and wishing her the best -- whatever that might mean .
+1 a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards , 'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary .
+1 still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at 'face value' to recommend to anyone looking for something different .
-1 it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
-1 visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it .
-1 the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
-1 it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish .
+1 the direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority , and the performances by harris , phifer and cam'ron seal the deal .

-1 fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .
+1 originality ain't on the menu , but there's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller .
-1 hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading .
-1 not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too .
-1 there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser .
-1 it's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut , mad cows .
+1 ana is a vivid , vibrant individual and the movie's focus upon her makes it successful and accessible .
-1 stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .
-1 we just don't really care too much about this love story . in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .
+1 this may be dover kosashvili's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic .
-1 apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .
+1 the film gets close to the chimps the same way goodall did , with a serious minded patience , respect and affection .
-1 no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess .
-1 merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women's expense .
-1 this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .
+1 watstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay's sappier elements . . . and sustains off the hook's buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer .
-1 gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing .
-1 returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .
-1 we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .
+1 arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year
+1 with lesser talents , high crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable . with freeman and judd , i'll at least remember their characters .
-1 if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles .
+1 could have been crisper and punchier , but it's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies .
+1 if i have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story ( like , say , treasure planet ) or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , i'll take the latter every time .
+1 while tattoo borrows heavily from both seven and the silence of the lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in .
+1 the story is virtually impossible to follow here , but there's a certain style and wit to the dialogue .
-1 shanghai ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage .
-1 this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .
+1 could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? in a word : no .
-1 yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents .
+1 while the now 72-year-old robert evans been slowed down by a stroke , he has at least one more story to tell : his own .
-1 " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes .

+1 beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom .
-1 an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes .
-1 it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
-1 the movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy .
-1 even fans of ismail merchant's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .
+1 slight but enjoyable documentary .
+1 there's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable .
+1 mark pellington's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth .
-1 at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s . at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .
-1 there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .
+1 anyone who's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved . these people are really going to love the piano teacher .
-1 mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .
+1 a compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day .
+1 both grant and hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others .
-1 unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny .
+1 . . . the first 2/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor . . .
-1 starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill .
+1 this is cool , slick stuff , ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters .
-1 full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .
-1 a working class " us vs . them " opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .
-1 report card : doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement . doesn't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) .
-1 appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites .
+1 a movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart .
-1 would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all .
+1 the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure .
+1 the film is insightful about kissinger's background and history .
-1 this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .
-1 two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .
-1 this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie .
-1 the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
+1 in between all the emotional seesawing , it's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived . but they fascinate in their recklessness .
+1 the way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful .

+1 an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment .
-1 it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie—if only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch .
-1 . . . hokey art house pretension .
-1 ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous .

-1 an " o bruin , where art thou ? " -style cross-country adventure . . . it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack .
+1 boomers and their kids will have a barrie good time .
+1 if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of " the isle " you'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else .
-1 . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves .
+1 . . . a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance
-1 as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles , 'swept away' sinks .
-1 this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable .
-1 . . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism .
-1 it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either .
+1 much of all about lily chou-chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep .
-1 the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) .
+1 human resources was a good , straightforward tale , but time out is better . it's haunting . it's like a poem .
-1 doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .
+1 like the english patient and the unbearable lightness of being , the hours is one of those reputedly " unfilmable " novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right .
+1 below may not mark mr . twohy's emergence into the mainstream , but his promise remains undiminished .

+1 interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story .
+1 a miraculous movie , i'm going home is so slight , yet overflows with wisdom and emotion .

-1 'this movie sucks . '
-1 [at least] moore is a real charmer .
-1 guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it's not scary in the slightest .
-1 by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious .
+1 [westbrook] makes a wonderful subject for the camera .
-1 feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
+1 k-19 : the widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining .
-1 no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .
+1 a charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest dogme film and among the most enjoyable .
+1 it's refreshing to see a romance this smart .
-1 by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .
-1 too much power , not enough puff .
+1 not a film to rival to live , but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted .
-1 a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée .
-1 part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole .
+1 a worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant 'co-stars . '
-1 the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen--and a hollywood-ized austen at that .
-1 summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this .
-1 a dreadful live-action movie .
-1 trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .

+1 . . . manages to fall closer in quality to silence than to the abysmal hannibal .
+1 some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and heaven is one such beast .
+1 when your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like goldie hawn and susan sarandon at their raunchy best , even hokum goes down easily .
-1 a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .
-1 though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
+1 while not all that bad of a movie , it's nowhere near as good as the original .
+1 this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground .
-1 if you've got a house full of tots -- don't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then .

-1 at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot .
-1 . . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare's macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention .

+1 the film has several strong performances .
-1 the script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair .
+1 exciting and well-paced .
+1 begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish .
-1 helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome .
-1 terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .
+1 director alfonso cuaron gets vivid , convincing performances from a fine cast , and generally keeps things going at a rapid pace , occasionally using an omniscient voice-over narrator in the manner of french new wave films .
+1 director-writer bille august . . . depicts this relationship with economical grace , letting his superb actors convey martin's deterioration and barbara's sadness -- and , occasionally , anger .
-1 much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad .
+1 birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .
+1 it's a compelling and horrifying story , and the laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america .
-1 sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .
-1 less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations .
-1 plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
+1 the attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way .
+1 the 3-d vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry .
-1 what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie .
-1 the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound .
-1 execrable .
-1 no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .
-1 manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious .
+1 smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way .
-1 for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets [sci-fi] rehash .
-1 it's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters , including ana's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana's future .
+1 despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity .
-1 . . . lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar .
-1 . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic .
+1 scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario .
+1 often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part .
+1 both damning and damned compelling .
+1 for those who pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste , this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their * * * off for an hour-and-a-half .
-1 may puzzle his most ardent fans .
+1 the four feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes .
+1 run , don't walk , to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen .
-1 usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it .
+1 how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood . it's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .
-1 davis has energy , but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly .
-1 too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility .
+1 the first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it's actually watchable . even more baffling is that it's funny .
+1 a fascinating , dark thriller that keeps you hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction .
+1 a tasty slice of droll whimsy .
-1 ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ?
+1 a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship .
+1 it might be tempting to regard mr . andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but mr . earnhart's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists .
+1 watching this film , what we feel isn't mainly suspense or excitement . the dominant feeling is something like nostalgia .
+1 while this movie , by necessity , lacks fellowship's heart , two towers outdoes its spectacle .
+1 as a first-time director , paxton has tapped something in himself as an actor that provides frailty with its dark soul .
+1 for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded .
+1 [grant] goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering and captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it .
-1 cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .
-1 the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
-1 the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
+1 the story , like life , refuses to be simple , and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions .
+1 sheds light on a subject few are familiar with , and makes you care about music you may not have heard before .
+1 it's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the american people to see what a candidate is like when he's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech .
+1 efficient , suitably anonymous chiller .
-1 tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination .
-1 . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else .
+1 lathan and diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest .
-1 they're going through the motions , but the zip is gone .
-1 the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen .
-1 dreary tale of middle-class angst
-1 girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy .
+1 you might not want to hang out with samantha , but you'll probably see a bit of yourself in her unfinished story .
-1 when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .
-1 i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless .
-1 just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .
-1 tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art .
+1 it's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties .
-1 a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie .
+1 what time is it there ? is not easy . it haunts you , you can't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it .
+1 rubbo's humorously tendentious intervention into the who-wrote-shakespeare controversy .
-1 after a while , hoffman's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial .
-1 despite the pyrotechnics , narc is strictly by the book .
+1 despite its flaws . . . belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn .
+1 in the affable maid in manhattan , jennifer lopez's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm , the diva shrewdly surrounds herself with a company of strictly a-list players .
-1 this is a good movie in spurts , but when it doesn't work , it's at important times .
-1 what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !
+1 one of the most exciting action films to come out of china in recent years .
+1 while scorsese's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that " gangs " is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about .
-1 the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .
+1 the message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another .
+1 because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before .
+1 jones has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers .
-1 some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent .
+1 a modestly surprising movie .
+1 enticing and often funny documentary .
-1 by turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy .
+1 it's so good that you can practically see the hollywood 'suits' trying to put together the cast and filmmaking team for the all-too -inevitable american remake .
-1 a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs . robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women .
+1 an unflinching , complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen .
+1 a positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera .
-1 sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .
+1 an engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character .
-1 everything is off .
-1 interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots .
-1 the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
+1 a first-class , thoroughly involving b movie that effectively combines two surefire , beloved genres -- the prison flick and the fight film .
-1 instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ?
+1 cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone .
-1 an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .
-1 this may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar .
+1 you just know something terrible is going to happen . but when it does , you're entirely unprepared .
-1 as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
-1 everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste .
+1 it will not appeal to the impatient , but those who like long books and movies will admire the way it accumulates power and depth .
-1 it's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old .
+1 as directed by dani kouyate of burkina faso , sia lacks visual flair . but kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them .
-1 [t]his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen .
+1 despite a quieter middle section , involving aragorn's dreams of arwen , this is even better than the fellowship . there are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away .
-1 the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart .
+1 a thoroughly engaging , surprisingly touching british comedy .
+1 despite besson's high-profile name being wasabi's big selling point , there is no doubt that krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film's thoroughly winning tone .
+1 funny and also heartwarming without stooping to gooeyness .
-1 what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits .
-1 those unfamiliar with mormon traditions may find the singles ward occasionally bewildering .
+1 in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century . . . takes kurys' career to a whole new level .
+1 what a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride . this is a more fascinating look at the future than " bladerunner " and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen .
+1 it is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth .
-1 it's harmless , diverting fluff . but it's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .
+1 what's most memorable about circuit is that it's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large . . . and small . . . with considerable aplomb .
+1 whatever complaints i might have , i'd take [its] earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor's club any time .
+1 an amused indictment of jaglom's own profession .
+1 expect no major discoveries , nor any stylish sizzle , but the film sits with square conviction and touching good sense on the experience of its women .
-1 a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .
+1 although commentary on nachtwey is provided . . . it's the image that really tells the tale .
+1 an original and highly cerebral examination of the psychopathic mind
-1 some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot .
-1 the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one .
-1 starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés .
+1 we need [moore's] noisy , cocky energy , his passion and class consciousness ; we need his shticks , we need his stones .
+1 . . . plenty of warmth to go around , with music and laughter and the love of family .
+1 an odd drama set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the midwest that held my interest precisely because it didn't try to .
+1 in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded .
+1 although it's a bit smug and repetitive , this documentary engages your brain in a way few current films do .
+1 has a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion .
-1 this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better .
+1 this version moves beyond the original's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema's inability to stand in for true , lived experience .
-1 so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .
+1 the mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs .
-1 the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects — from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed .
-1 it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .
-1 a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set .
+1 we've seen the hippie-turned-yuppie plot before , but there's an enthusiastic charm in <i ? fire that makes the formula fresh again .
-1 feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
+1 about a boy vividly recalls the cary grant of room for one more , houseboat and father goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him .
-1 a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing .
+1 birthday girl lucks out with chaplin and kidman , who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie's darker turns .
-1 waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway .
+1 runs on the pure adrenalin of pacino's performance .
-1 it's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original .
+1 the film's strength isn't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears .
-1 made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because [solondz's] cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt .
-1 no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story .
+1 " the quiet american " begins in saigon in 1952 . that's its first sign of trouble .
+1 so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor .
-1 i'm just too bored to care .
-1 seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one .
+1 a real audience-pleaser that will strike a chord with anyone who's ever waited in a doctor's office , emergency room , hospital bed or insurance company office .
-1 more intellectually scary than dramatically involving .
-1 the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .
+1 like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely .
-1 features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory .
+1 george clooney , in his first directorial effort , presents this utterly ridiculous shaggy dog story as one of the most creative , energetic and original comedies to hit the screen in years .
-1 . . . a pretentious mess . . .
+1 what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors .
-1 . . . instead go rent " shakes the clown " , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance .
-1 i can't remember the last time i saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there's only one problem…it's supposed to be a drama .
+1 made-up lampoons the moviemaking process itself , while shining a not particularly flattering spotlight on america's skin-deep notions of pulchritude .
+1 bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique , entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal .
-1 a negligible british comedy .
-1 if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four- minute egg .
-1 unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate .
-1 as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .
-1 screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
+1 this is simply the most fun you'll ever have with a documentary !
-1 . . . unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .
-1 american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indian-american would recognize . and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .
+1 a potent allegorical love story .
-1 [davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race .
+1 even if invincible is not quite the career peak that the pianist is for roman polanski , it demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken .
-1 the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste .
+1 mais um momento inspirado de david fincher .
+1 so unique and stubborn and charismatic that you want it to be better and more successful than it is .
-1 this is nothing but familiar territory .
-1 the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating .
+1 not everyone will welcome or accept the trials of henry kissinger as faithful portraiture , but few can argue that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one .
-1 amazingly lame .
-1 an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .
+1 what saves it . . . and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice .
+1 even when he's not at his most critically insightful , godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work .
-1 the lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it .
-1 it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental .
+1 broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed .
-1 the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
-1 there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .
+1 occasionally , in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks , a jaded critic smacks into something truly new .
-1 it's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .
-1 samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal

+1 campanella's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael's evolution .

+1 cool ? this movie is a snow emergency .
-1 i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin' down .
+1 an escapist confection that's pure entertainment .
-1 it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .
-1 like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal .
-1 director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times .
-1 i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .
+1 the dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen .
-1 sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology . but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed .
+1 [the digital effects] reminded me of terry gilliam's rudimentary old monty python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together .
+1 a poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature .
+1 sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching .
-1 . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .
-1 a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda .
+1 anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but can't afford the $20 million ticket to ride a russian rocket should catch this imax offering .
+1 thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality . . . takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda .
+1 shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion .
-1 a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .
-1 i'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .
+1 it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness .
+1 equilibrium is what george orwell might have imagined had today's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 .

+1 highly irritating at first , mr . koury's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results .
-1 with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment .

+1 leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time .
-1 if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and cliché .
+1 one feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism .
-1 the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .
-1 a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .
+1 a delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional .
-1 schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle .
+1 warm and exotic .
-1 such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production .
+1 the movie plays up the cartoon's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength .
+1 the movie is hardly a masterpiece , but it does mark ms . bullock's best work in some time .

+1 thanks to ice cube , benjamins feels an awful lot like friday in miami .
-1 as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west .
+1 a pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances .
+1 in auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer .
+1 though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes .
+1 what's surprising about full frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you .
+1 monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds .
+1 my wife is an actress is an utterly charming french comedy that feels so american in sensibility and style it's virtually its own hollywood remake .
+1 much of what we see is horrible but it's also undeniably exceedingly clever .
-1 this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .
-1 the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .
-1 there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .
+1 not too fancy , not too filling , not too fluffy , but definitely tasty and sweet .
+1 the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for gai's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her .
-1 the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .
-1 as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms . redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality .
+1 a thought-provoking look at how western foreign policy - however well intentioned - can wreak havoc in other cultures .

+1 a compelling portrait of moral emptiness
+1 goofy , nutty , consistently funny . and educational !

+1 the fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that broomfield's interviewees , or even himself , will not be for much longer .

+1 a pleasant romantic comedy .
+1 one can't deny its seriousness and quality .

-1 this is the first film i've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved .
-1 the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about .
-1 as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .

+1 theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical .
-1 a selection of scenes in search of a movie .
-1 a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu .

+1 this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998's whatever .
-1 though catch me if you can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .
+1 the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back .

-1 the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .
-1 everything is pegged into the groove of a new york dating comedy with 'issues' to simplify .
+1 doug liman , the director of bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses damon's ability to be focused and sincere .

-1 if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride .
-1 this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero .

+1 …an adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle .

+1 far from heaven is a dazzling conceptual feat , but more than that , it's a work of enthralling drama .

-1 with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie .
-1 it's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it's one of the worst of the entire franchise .
-1 such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution .

+1 very predictable but still entertaining
+1 you won't have any trouble getting kids to eat up these veggies .
+1 what makes barbershop so likable , with all its flaws , is that it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies .
-1 the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo .

-1 solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that soderbergh's best films , " erin brockovich , " " out of sight " and " ocean's eleven , " never were .
-1 solaris " is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work .
-1 a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original .
+1 it's like an old warner bros . costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie errol flynn always wanted to make , though bette davis , cast as joan , would have killed him .
-1 formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor .

+1 it will break your heart many times over .
+1 the gorgeously elaborate continuation of " the lord of the rings " trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe co-writer/director peter jackson's expanded vision of j . r . r . tolkien's middle-earth .
+1 a bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass .
+1 the spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist .
-1 jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter's glory days on three's company .
+1 this bracingly truthful antidote to hollywood teenage movies that slather clearasil over the blemishes of youth captures the combustible mixture of a chafing inner loneliness and desperate grandiosity that tend to characterize puberty .
+1 by no means a slam-dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act , it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story .
+1 what's not to like about a movie with a 'children's' song that includes the line 'my stepdad's not mean , he's just adjusting' ?

+1 it's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the marks family .
-1 interesting , but not compelling .
-1 outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .
-1 ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok .
-1 fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race .
-1 to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable .

-1 ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on .
+1 the 3d images only enhance the film's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen .
+1 from the dull , surreal ache of mortal awareness emerges a radiant character portrait .
-1 there's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery .
-1 there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms isn't it .
+1 a stylistic romp that's always fun to watch .
-1 not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .
-1 it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .
-1 [p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders .

-1 too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
-1 barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material .
+1 boldly engineering a collision between tawdry b-movie flamboyance and grandiose spiritual anomie , rose's film , true to its source material , provides a tenacious demonstration of death as the great equalizer .
-1 a incompetência de marcus adams como roteirista só é superada por sua péssima direção .
-1 the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .
+1 washington overcomes the script's flaws and envelops the audience in his character's anguish , anger and frustration .
+1 this is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller .

+1 close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trash-cinema roots to be a breath of fresh air .
+1 solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike .
+1 the year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but take care of my cat emerges as the very best of them .
+1 if you're not into the pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years won't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open . but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi .
-1 gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh .
-1 in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space .
+1 [an] absorbing documentary .
+1 the cast . . . keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired .
-1 call me a cynic , but there's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message .
-1 the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects .
-1 in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled .
-1 soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable .
+1 it's tough to watch , but it's a fantastic movie .
-1 charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions .
-1 it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .
+1 worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees .
-1 with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful .
-1 bad company . bad movie . just plain bad .
+1 a tale of horror and revenge that is nearly perfect in its relentless descent to the depths of one man's tortured soul .
+1 not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense .

+1 feels untidily honest .
+1 despite these annoyances , the capable clayburgh and tambor really do a great job of anchoring the characters in the emotional realities of middle age .
+1 easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year .
+1 until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity .
+1 if you liked such movies as notting hill , four weddings and a funeral , bridget jones' diary or high fidelity , then you won't want to miss about a boy .
-1 though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .
+1 a sensitive and astute first feature by anne-sophie birot .
+1 the success of undercover brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally .
-1 the sheer dumbness of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down .

-1 the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year .

-1 heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .

+1 unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises .

+1 a charming but slight comedy .
+1 doesn't do more than expand a tv show to movie length . however , it's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome .
-1 if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .
-1 if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .
-1 like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it .

-1 the film can depress you about life itself .
+1 family portrait of need , neurosis and nervy negativity is a rare treat that shows the promise of digital filmmaking .
+1 . . . quite endearing .
+1 rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword , jiang wen's devils on the doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of joseph heller or kurt vonnegut .
+1 what saves this deeply affecting film from being merely a collection of wrenching cases is corcuera's attention to detail .
+1 . . . does such a fine job of engulfing you in its world and allying you with its characters' choices , good and ill , that its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought .

+1 [stephen] earnhart's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have .
+1 though few will argue that it ranks with the best of herzog's works , invincible shows he's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film .
-1 large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better .
-1 while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
-1 putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest .
+1 seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , as happiness was . . . hence , storytelling is far more appealing .
-1 affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into , a role that ford effortlessly filled with authority .
-1 with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low .

-1 there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen's men .
+1 while most films these days are about nothing , this film seems to be about everything that's plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world .
-1 too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .
+1 executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor and appreciation of the daily grind that only the most hardhearted scrooge could fail to respond .

-1 the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
+1 a thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses grant's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos .
+1 less an examination of neo-nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself .
+1 though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film doesn't ignore the more problematic aspects of brown's life .
-1 star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before . wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty .
+1 exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven… [the film] addresses in a fascinating , intelligent manner the intermingling of race , politics and local commerce .
+1 as any creature-feature fan knows , when you cross toxic chemicals with a bunch of exotic creatures , you get a lot of running around , screaming and death . on that score , the film certainly doesn't disappoint .

+1 a brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel .
+1 the mothman prophecies is best when illustrating the demons bedevilling the modern masculine journey .
+1 while we no longer possess the lack-of-attention span that we did at seventeen , we had no trouble sitting for blade ii .
-1 what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .

-1 obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script .
+1 this engrossing , characteristically complex tom clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time .

+1 the film grows on you . and how .
-1 at a time when we've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture .

-1 the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal .
+1 the word that comes to mind , while watching eric rohmer's tribute to a courageous scottish lady , is painterly .
+1 it's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works .
-1 clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
+1 a full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution .
+1 what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map .
-1 writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon .
+1 es divertida , visualmente espectacular y muy entretenida . simple y sencillamente te sorprenderá .
+1 morvern callar confirms lynne ramsay as an important , original talent in international cinema .
+1 moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought . better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift .
+1 what doesn't this film have that an impressionable kid couldn't stand to hear ?
+1 anchored by friel and williams's exceptional performances , the film's power lies in its complexity . nothing is black and white .
-1 the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .

+1 pray has really done his subject justice .
+1 it's not a great monster movie . but if you've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn , there's guilty fun to be had here . chomp chomp !
+1 a brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy .
-1 the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
-1 the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters .
-1 where the film falters is in its tone .
+1 director of photography benoit delhomme shot the movie in delicious colors , and the costumes and sets are grand .
+1 cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective .
+1 [a] thoughtful , visually graceful work .
+1 cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out , and at other times outside looking in .
+1 a small gem from belgium .
-1 the star who helped give a spark to " chasing amy " and " changing lanes " falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , " the sum of all fears . "
+1 thoroughly engrossing and ultimately tragic .
-1 an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .
+1 director andrew niccol . . . demonstrates a wry understanding of the quirks of fame . his healthy sense of satire is light and fun . . . .
-1 contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin .

+1 karmen moves like rhythm itself , her lips chanting to the beat , her long , braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat .
-1 the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat .
-1 blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period .
+1 a pretty decent kid-pleasing , tolerable-to-adults lark of a movie .
+1 inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it's not that , it's the tension that keeps you in your seat . affleck and jackson are good sparring partners .
+1 a fascinating examination of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery made by a proper , middle-aged woman .
+1 after watching it , you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history .
-1 in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little .
-1 an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . .
-1 this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson .
+1 here's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep . but taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , the queen of the damned cannot be said to suck .

+1 whatever one makes of its political edge , this is beautiful filmmaking from one of french cinema's master craftsmen .
+1 witherspoon puts to rest her valley-girl image , but it's dench who really steals the show .

-1 never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction .
-1 dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring .
+1 makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the kurdish refugees of iran's borderlands .
+1 the unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right .
-1 de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest .
+1 it's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it's brilliant .
+1 the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier's oft-brilliant safe conduct ( " laissez-passer " ) wears its heart on its sleeve .
-1 despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break .
-1 i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x .

+1 the moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended .
-1 in its chicken heart , crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises .
+1 romantic comedy and dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows , but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here .

+1 we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies .
+1 maud and roland's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but labute pulls off a neater trick in possession : he makes language sexy .

-1 a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .
+1 ferrara's strongest and most touching movie of recent years .
-1 by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest cannot be revived .
-1 i got a headache watching this meaningless downer .
+1 by its modest , straight-ahead standards , undisputed scores a direct hit .

+1 charming and funny ( but ultimately silly ) movie .
-1 aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .

+1 it may . . . work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scooby-doo shows or reruns .

-1 myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .
+1 disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself .

+1 lilia's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth .
-1 should have gone straight to video . it looks like an action movie , but it's so poorly made , on all levels , that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such .

+1 one of [jaglom's] better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love .
-1 it's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting .
+1 [city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year .

+1 unlike most teen flicks , swimming takes its time to tell its story , casts mostly little-known performers in key roles , and introduces some intriguing ambiguity .

+1 may seriously impair your ability to ever again maintain a straight face while speaking to a highway patrolman .
+1 argento , at only 26 , brings a youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness to the project , as if she's cut open a vein and bled the raw film stock .

+1 the filmmakers' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the girls' environment .
